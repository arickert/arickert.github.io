   <title>Newsletter #23: A New Age of Empire, with Ho-fung Hung</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter23"/>
   <updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by William Harris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Shanghai for a few years during the decade following the 2008 financial crash. This was a time in which Western journalists approached China with their mouths open. They gawked over GDP rates, the rise of preposterously large cities, the statistical delirium of a rising economy of 1.5 billion people, and the gauche ways China’s nouveau riche brandished their wealth. They gawked over rumblings of protest, and they gawked over how precarious it all seemed — how the real estate market teetered on the brink, how likely it was that this fantastical economic engine would sputter into collapse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard for me, too, not to sometimes see China with those eyes. Every time I would fly into Shanghai, the view on my cab ride home would change: new high rises, whole neighborhoods transformed in a matter of months, intensifying clouds of smog that the poor breathed in and the rich magicked away with air purifiers. Perhaps things were precarious, but they also seemed like emblems of a new capitalist horizon. There was a brilliant elegance to the late political economist Giovanni Arrighi’s story of succeeding world hegemons, in which a once-dominant power like Britain grew indebted to an upstart nation like the US and thus helped along the new superpower’s rise, just as centuries before, Genoese merchant capitalists had grown indebted to Holland and made possible the Dutch empire’s ascendance. Arrighi’s final book, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/347-adam-smith-in-beijing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, hinted that the same process might be underway again: the US as declining debtor-superpower on the verge of being surpassed by creditor-power China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as sociologist Ho-fung Hung explains in 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/clash-of-empires-w-ho-fung-hung/&quot;&gt;part two of his interview&lt;/a&gt; with 
, this hasn’t happened. Instead, China’s growth rate has fallen to more modest levels, and our era has become less one of geopolitical succession than one of confrontational geopolitical stalemate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to Ho-fung Hung’s interview with 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/clash-of-empires-w-ho-fung-hung/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the effects of this new world have been bleak: ramped-up militarism, war. But might this geopolitical situation also provide openings? Hung suggests a Keynesian solution, where China and the US enact programs of domestic economic redistribution so growth can proceed internally, calming imperial battles over external markets. There are reasons to hope for this and reasons to remain skeptical: the imbalance of class forces, the environmental consequences of expanded consumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hung also mentions a second opening to watch out for. “Our analysis focuses too much on big powers and big empires without paying enough attention to smaller states,” Hung says. From Tanzania to the Philippines, nationalism is on the rise across the world, and multi-polarity provides small states the chance to play big powers against each other. This could just lead to exacerbated tensions — but it could lead, too, to more room for small left-leaning regimes, like the ones once again on the rise in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #22: Capitalist China, with Ho-fung Hung</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter22"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Mack Penner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/china-boom-w-ho-fung-hung/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;: in a little over an hour, Ho-fung Hung, author of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-china-boom/9780231164191&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, covers more than two centuries of political-economic development in China, all the while weaving in and out of Marxist accumulation theory, Immanuel Wallersteinian world-systems theory, and 
 historiography. What more could we ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, importantly, two time-scales at work in the interview: a period of centuries over which China occupied a subordinate position in the workings of global capitalism; and a more recent period, only a couple of decades in existence, during which China has become a superpower. The forthcoming second episode with Hung, on the financial crisis of 2008 and more, delves further into the latter period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rise over recent decades has been dramatic, so it can seem novel. As former 
 guest Isabella Weber points out in her book, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledge.com/How-China-Escaped-Shock-Therapy-The-Market-Reform-Debate/Weber/p/book/9781032008493&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from 1990 to 2017, the Chinese share of global GDP went from hardly more than 2 percent to nearly 13 percent. Today, according to the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD&quot;&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN&quot;&gt;Chinese share&lt;/a&gt; is well above 15 percent. If the Chinese Communist Party can meet its 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b96db9c0-5e92-4957-96d0-cbf44ebf7425&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; for economic growth, modest only by recent Chinese standards, China could represent fully one-fifth of world GDP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures are stunning. But as we learn in the episode, China’s subordinate geoeconomic status in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the real historical anomaly. In the early modern period, and for centuries on-and-off beforehand, Chinese society was characterized by high living standards and flourishing commerce. As Hung notes in 
, citing political scientist Joseph Nye, recent Chinese history is actually better understood as a “renaissance” than a “rise.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;argues that despite growing Chinese geoeconomic and geopolitical power, China is unlikely to fundamentally upend the global capitalist system in the long term — in part because it has benefitted from that system. This point rhymes with the analysis of some other observers: 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674987593&quot;&gt;Branko Milanovic&lt;/a&gt;, for example, suggests that competition between China and the United States is a contest between versions of capitalism rather than a clash of fundamentally different systems. A China-dominated world system would still be a capitalist world system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should we make of the China boom? We might get our bearings by keeping one eye on each of the time scales that feature in the episode. In the short term, we should remember that inter-imperial rivalry between large capitalist states doesn’t have a great track record, to say the least. Panning out, we might want to consider the final passages in 
, where Hung calls it “unthinkable that the upcoming crises might be more daunting than the ones China has weathered over the centuries” and predicts that “its robust capitalist development will continue for a long time.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we consider the possibility, in China and elsewhere, of further capitalist development over the long-term, the obvious question is: how long do we have? As Kate Aronoff has argued on 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/climate-politics-with-kate-aronoff/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, even if the end of capitalism is not likely to come for a long time, managing the climate crisis still urgently requires a “
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/08/capitalism-climate-crisis-global-green-new-deal-clean-energy-fossil-fuel-industry&quot;&gt;radical shift in our current economic order.&lt;/a&gt;” In the long run, however long it turns out to be, the battle over what that radical shift will look like is of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Isabella Weber, her 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/how-china-escaped-shock-therapy-w-isabella-weber/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with 
 is a clear archival complement to Hung’s two-part interview. Hung’s new book, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/east-asian-government-politics-and-policy/clash-empires-chimerica-new-cold-war?format=PB&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will be out shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s springtime in the northern hemisphere, meaning that summer reading plans are being made. Hung’s references to debates in the theory and history of capitalism could make for inspiration. You might dabble in the capitalist transition debates via the “
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/history/european-history-1000-1450/brenner-debate-agrarian-class-structure-and-economic-development-pre-industrial-europe?format=PB&quot;&gt;Brenner Debate&lt;/a&gt;.” Or you might read Immanuel Wallerstein’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/World-Systems-Analysis/&quot;&gt;introduction to world-systems analysis&lt;/a&gt;. The really good stuff, however, is 
 history and historiography. Summer 2022 as the summer of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520081147/civilization-and-capitalism-15th-18th-century-vol-i&quot;&gt;Fernand Braudel&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #21: A Left Internationalist Response to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, with Sophie Pinkham and Nick Mulder</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter21"/>
   <updated>2022-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter21</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Michal Schatz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended the global economy and thrown the future of the international political order into question. This new conjuncture raises key questions about foreign policy and internationalism that the US left has tended to subordinate to domestic issues.The 
Dig’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;with Sophie Pinkham and Nick Mulder highlights what’s at stake in global politics at the moment — and makes clear why today’s Left must develop not only an anti-imperialist foreign policy agenda, but a positive vision for left internationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shelling continues in cities across Ukraine and crippling sanctions are rapidly tanking the Russian economy, the question everyone across the political spectrum keeps asking iswhyRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine without threat or provocation. Mulder points out that the USSR’s dissolution was not a discrete event, but the beginning of a process of imperial collapse. Russia’s recent aggression could be understood as a continuation of this process. This is useful to remember when thinking about global politics beyond the war. Many US Cold War elites and their neoliberal progeny saw in the Soviet Union’s disintegration a permanent victory for American power, but history is constantly unfolding; the unipolar power that the United States claimed in the wake of Soviet dissolution was perhaps an extension of that collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moment demands a renewal of robust Left internationalism. The resurgence of the US left since Trump’s 2016 election has reframed key aspects of domestic politics, but we have yet to develop an equivalent for foreign policy. Today’s US left is rightly anti-imperialist and anti-militarist, but without a corresponding vision for what we are seeking to build in its place, these positions end up manifesting as circumscribed responses to discrete conflicts with few concrete demands. Anti-imperialism does not mean retreating from international politics but developing both domestic and foreign policy programs in solidarity with working people globally. As&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/aziz-rana/&quot;&gt;Aziz 
Rana&lt;/a&gt;wrote forJacobinin 2019, internationalist thinking about domestic problems is a critical prerequisite to building any Left foreign policy agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of recently published writing on Ukraine is dizzying. Check out Sophie Pinkham’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/what-young-ukrainians-have-lost-overnight&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;with eleven young Ukrainians about their experiences of the war. Nick Mulder’s recently published book&lt;a href=&quot;https://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780300259360&quot;&gt;The 
Economic 
Weapon: 
The 
Rise 
of 
Sanctions 
as 
a 
Tool 
of 
Modern 
War&lt;/a&gt;is essential to understand the history of sanctions and how they helped to remake the world leading up to the Second World War. In this 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2022/03/ukraine-socialist-interview-russian-invasion-war-putin-nato-imperialism/&quot;&gt;Jacobin 
interview&lt;/a&gt;, Ukrainian sociologist Volodymyr Artiukh offers an incisive analysis of the Russian invasion. David Klion provided an&lt;a href=&quot;https://jewishcurrents.org/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-an-explainer&quot;&gt;early 
overview&lt;/a&gt;of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forJewish 
Currents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On foreign policy, historian and former Bernie Sanders foreign policy advisor Daniel Bessner has spoken about developing an&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/03/imperialism-foreign-policy-biden-obama-iran-israel&quot;&gt;anti-imperialist

policy 
agenda&lt;/a&gt;and outlined a path to&lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/159672/tomorrow-world-wertheim-book-review-birth-america-world-power&quot;&gt;reducing

limitations 
of 
“realism”&lt;/a&gt;in analyzing the war. And thisDiginterview with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/russia-invades-w-tony-wood/&quot;&gt;Tony 
Wood&lt;/a&gt;helps contextualize the current conflict while Dan’s interview with Ukrainian sociologist&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/ukraine-w-volodymyr-ishchenko/&quot;&gt;Volodymyr 
Ischenko&lt;/a&gt;prior to the invasion continues to provide important insight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #20: Slapping Back the Invisible Hand, with Kim Phillips-Fein </title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter20"/>
   <updated>2022-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter20</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, the belief that left-wing activism is responsible for a surge of right-wing reaction has become a sort of catechism for talking heads and mainstream Democrats who insist that calls to “defund the police” are the single greatest threat to the Democratic Party’s political prospects. For want of immediate evidence, centrists intone sagely about the election of 1972, when George McGovern and his radical supporters pushed white, middle-class suburbanites into the arms of Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Phillips-Fein’s 2009 bookInvisible 
Hands: 
The 
Businessmen’s 
Crusade 
Against 
the 
New 
Dealargues against this “backlash” narrative. Phillips-Fein locates the roots of the Right’s rise not in the cultural politics of the New Left, but in the 1930s, when a small group of wealthy businessmen refused to accommodate themselves to the New Deal order. Though their fierce opposition to the welfare state put them at the political margins during the 1930s, these reactionaries helped tame American liberalism in the 1940s and 1950s while laying the groundwork for the Reagan Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the institutions they built and the networks of conservative businessmen they cultivated, opponents of the New Deal waged a decades-long war to transform the ways that Americans thought about the market, organized labor, and the role of federal government. Above all else, they worked to convince people — in particular cultural conservatives — that free enterprise and entrepreneurship represented the highest expressions of human freedom, and thus that any effort at asserting democratic control over the generation and distribution of wealth, must be understood as an assault on the most cherished values of a free people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen 
to 
The 
Dig’s 
interview 
with 
Kim 
Phillips-Fein 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/invisible-hands-w-kim-phillips-fein/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, we canalmostreadInvisible 
Handsas a road map for the contemporary Left: an example of how a small band of committed activists can, over the course of decades of steadfast political commitment, transform mainstream assumptions about economics and politics. But we should be wary of drawing too many direct lessons from this story. After all, few leftists have the cash, and few one-percenters have the inclination, to fund this sort of ideological campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are lessons to be gleaned from Phillips-Fein’s interpretation of the conservative movement. As we search for a useable past, we should look for links and threads across eras. Just as the roots of the neoliberalism of the 1980s and 1990s might be found in the early New Deal, the roots of some future Left may be found in social formations and forms of protest which seem marginal today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Phillips-Fein and Dan discuss in this week’s interview, the limits of the libertarian worldview have been put into particularly sharp relief in recent years. It is — or at least it should be — impossible to view exposure to an airborne pandemic as a matter of individual responsibility. And yet, from the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bidens-pandemic-w-justin-feldman/&quot;&gt;Biden 
administration’s 
push 
for 
a 
return 
to 
normal&lt;/a&gt;while a pandemic still rages, to the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/cryptocurrency-w-edward-ongweso-jr-jacob-silverman/&quot;&gt;feverish 
utopianism&lt;/a&gt;around&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/private-money-with-stefan-eich/&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, evidence of the persistence of this vision are all around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in the world these businessmen helped build. But while leftists may not be in a position to precisely trace the path of the businessmen’s crusade,Invisible 
Handsshould remind us that the political certainties of today may be anything but certain tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments from the war in Ukraine, ongoing for a week as I write this, are moving at a frenzied pace. Keeping up with the reporting seems to require hours of attention daily; keeping up with analysis of the war is at least equally challenging, as for every cogent and considered piece there are a great many more that are not worth the time of day. Which makes 
’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/russia-invades-w-tony-wood/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Tony Wood, author of 
, a welcome anchor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of war, there are few certainties, especially when it comes to matters of geopolitics. But as Wood discusses in the interview, current geopolitical uncertainty runs up against the very sure thing of climate change. Mitigating the worst outcomes of climate change requires concerted state action at the global level — and such action is nigh impossible to imagine in a warming world at war. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, it’s worth highlighting the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/5de27c61-0095-4add-8076-7469b27a4bb8&quot;&gt;recent news&lt;/a&gt; from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which released the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/&quot;&gt;latest portion&lt;/a&gt; of its major report. The previous installment was 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/ipcc-reports-verdict-on-climate-crimes-of-humanity-guilty-as-hell&quot;&gt;big news&lt;/a&gt; at the end of last summer; this one appeared much more quietly, three days into the Russian invasion. The findings conclude that the consequences of climate change are likely to be worse than previously thought. And what was previously thought wasn’t exactly rosy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC report is a litany of disasters both looming and already-arrived: destroyed ecosystems, rapidly rising seas, extreme weather, and trillions of dollars in damage and losses, to say nothing of the unquantifiable suffering that will be endured by living things. The “window of opportunity” in which human actions can intervene to stave off the worst and ensure the continuing habitability of the earth is closing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War imperils our collective ability to address the climate crisis. So, with war ongoing (
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2022/02/joe-biden-war-yemen-us-foreign-policy-humanitarian-crisis&quot;&gt;and not only in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;), what is to be done? Clearly left internationalism, anti-war and anti-capitalist, is required by the moment. Solidarity with the people of Ukraine goes without saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    On the war in Ukraine, be sure to have a look at the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/russia-invades-w-tony-wood/&quot;&gt;show notes&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, I recommend stepping out of the current discursive fervor and reading 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/gift-time-introduction/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Schell’s argument for the abolition of nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;, written more than twenty years ago and unfortunately still-relevant. For an understanding of Putin that you won’t get from the mainstream media, read Wood’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2839-russia-without-putin&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Read Andreas Malm’s opus, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2002-fossil-capital&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on the history of our current climate predicaments. Read Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/3138-climate-leviathan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on where we might go from here. And 
 has an 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/environment/&quot;&gt;extensive archive of climate episodes&lt;/a&gt;. Kate Aronoff’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/climate-politics-with-kate-aronoff/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; would be a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #18: A Radical — and Popular — Feminism in Latin America and Around the World, with Verónica Gago</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter18"/>
   <updated>2022-04-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter18</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Maia Silber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left feminists in the Global North have long lamented the corporate cooptation of the movement’s mainstream, even as more radical visions of gender justice seem unable to reach beyond the academy. But in Argentina, an international feminist movement has emerged that is both massive in its popular reach and unabashed in its insistence on linking the struggle against patriarchy to struggles against colonialism and neoliberal capitalism. It offers a model for activists around the world who want to use feminist analysis and tactics not only to advance women’s status within the existing order, but to transform that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s guest, Verónica Gago, is a political theorist, organizer, and member of Ni Una Menos (“Not One Less”), a Latin America–wide feminist collective that gained a global following in 2016 when it launched a women’s general strike following the rape and murder of sixteen-year-old Lucia Pérez. Gago’s work underscores the decades-old socialist-feminist argument that Ni Una Menos puts into practice: capitalism devalues “women’s work” by rendering it invisible 
aswork, and insisting on naming it as such can powerfully expand the horizons of labor organizing beyond the conventional setting of the shop floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Dig’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interview with Verónica Gago&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/feminist-international-w-veronica-gago/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ni Una Menos also inspired the International Women’s Strike (IWS) in 2017, which dovetailed in the United States with the resurgence of mainstream feminist activism following Donald Trump’s election. But while in Latin America, the IWS fed a growing movement that has subsequently launched mass protests against debt-fueling international monetary policy and austerity, the IWS in the United States was an isolated event with a disappointing turnout and negligible consequences. The contrast suggests that by linking women’s oppression to the broader erosion of social support under neoliberalism — rather than a narrow partisan agenda or a liberal demand for professional representation — US feminists might actually broaden their mass appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to Gago, I wondered if the pandemic might provide such an opportunity. While liberal feminists in the United States have occasionally lamented the pandemic’s consequences for women’s career opportunities, left feminists here might take a cue from Ni Una Menos to link increased care burdens for women to the state’s ongoing efforts to make private households responsible for collective health risks in the form of climate hazards, chronic disease, and occuupational dangers. Rather than simply attributing women’s pandemic woes to inequitable distributions of labor within the household, feminists taking aim at the neoliberal state might find common cause with existing pandemic campaigns against evictions, unsafe workplaces, and incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feminist strike, as Gago envisions it, is a means of uniting community members in a shared process of both hardship and care. In Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, that strike has been used to connect violence against women to the seizure of indigenous land and the imposition of household debt; elsewhere, that could mean connecting the demands of waged workers to those of welfare recipients or the victims of climate disasters. The key to building a feminism of the masses might be identifying gender as a cornerstone of today’s capitalist order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gago discusses these subjects and more at length in her two books 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/3660-feminist-international&quot;&gt;Feminist International: How to Change Everything&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/neoliberalism-from-below&quot;&gt;Neoliberalism from Below: Popular Pragmatics and Baroque Economics&lt;/a&gt;.Other excellent works using feminist analysis to examine the nature of labor and value under neoliberalism include Kathi Weeks’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-problem-with-work&quot;&gt;The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics, and Postwork Imaginaries&lt;/a&gt; and Melinda Cooper’s

   <title>Newsletter #17: The Maladies of Colonial Capitalism, with Raj Patel and Rupa Marya</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter17"/>
   <updated>2022-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Mack Penner &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 
’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/inflamed-w-raj-patel-and-rupa-marya/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Raj Patel and Rupa Marya makes clear, there are countless ways capitalism and colonialism are detrimental to human health. Accordingly, the interview and the book on which it is based, Patel and Marya’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374602529/inflamed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is many things at once: a history of health regimes and food systems under capitalism, a critique of the modern medical system, and an argument for decolonized medicine, to mention a few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to the interview, I was thinking about the relationship between Patel and Marya’s arguments and the history of Canada. One of the key ideas in the interview is the notion that health is related to our “exposome,” or the totality of our encounters with the world around us 
 the histories and structural logics that make our world what it is. As Marya explains in the interview, trauma is one of the most damaging aspects of the exposome, especially because it is transmitted across generations. The history of the Canadian settler colony, particularly its ongoing brutalization of its indigenous population, stands as evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this point, a couple of recent works on Canadian colonialism and the health of indigenous peoples come to mind. In 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://uofrpress.ca/Books/C/Clearing-the-Plains&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a widely noted and awarded work first published in 2014, James Daschuk explains the awful contemporary disparities in health outcomes between indigenous peoples and non-indigenous Canadians. To do this, Daschuk scans a period of centuries in which dispossession, disease, and famine, brought by settlers and its state agents, combined to impose and entrench ill health in indigenous communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is perhaps best known for the evidence it marshals to show that, in nineteenth-century western Canada, starvation was an intentionally imposed state policy used as a method of control to aid in settlement and the imposition of market capitalism in that region. It is common to acknowledge that Canadian settler colonialism entailed a form of “cultural genocide.” In fact, the qualifier is misleading. This history helps us understand the intergenerational toxicity of settler-colonial exposomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 
 listeners interested in exploring these questions further, Daschuk’s book would be well-complemented by Mary Jane Logan McCallum and Adele Perry’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://uofmpress.ca/books/detail/structures-of-indifference&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is focused on the city of Winnipeg and the thirty-four hour period in 2008 during which Brian Sinclair, a non-status Anishinaabe man, was left neglected and untreated in an emergency room, eventually dying from a treatable infection. By historicizing Sinclair’s death, McCallum and Perry show how “structures of indifference” are core to the settler-colonial exposome and its very real, everyday effects in contemporary Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listeners with access might be interested in the article “
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/chr.2018-0097&quot;&gt;Colonial Extractions: Oral Health Care and Indigenous Peoples in Canada, 1945-79&lt;/a&gt;” by historians Catherine Carstairs and Ian Mosby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the matter of capitalism and health care, Gabriel Winant’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/next-shift-with-gabriel-winant/&quot;&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt; is a must. From further back in the archive, you might want to revisit Leo Beletsky’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/the-origins-of-the-opioid-crisis-with-leo-beletsky/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; on the opioid crisis (also a brutal feature of the settler-colonial exposome in Canada). &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #16: The Real Story of What’s Happening in Ukraine, with Volodymyr Ishchenko</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter16"/>
   <updated>2022-04-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter16</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by William Harris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be forgiven for being confused about what’s happening in Ukraine. On the one hand, unless you have an admirable ability to tune out the mainstream US press, you have heard that Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed troops somewhere in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, and that a Russian invasion is now imminent. On the other hand, if you 
have been able to escape the insular punditry of these media narratives, you have perhaps heard the Ukrainian president say not only that war is not imminent, but also that the Biden administration should stop needlessly inciting tension and hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is happening? What motivates the Biden administration to inflate the likelihood of war? What motivates Putin to escalate conflict with Ukraine? And what, amid all this trumped-up war talk, do Ukraine’s own very different and competing political constituencies want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s 
Digepisode features Ukrainian sociologist Volodymyr Ishchenko, a brilliant analyst of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lefteast.org/contradictions-post-soviet-ukraine-failure-ukraine-new-left/&quot;&gt;social movements&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ponarseurasia.org/how-maidan-revolutions-reproduce-and-intensify-the-post-soviet-crisis-of-political-representation/&quot;&gt;revolutions&lt;/a&gt;, and the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lefteast.org/ukraine-in-the-vicious-circle-of-the-post-soviet-crisis-of-hegemony/&quot;&gt;crises of the post-Soviet world&lt;/a&gt;, who contextualizes all these questions and more by placing the current conflict in a long history that reaches back to World War II, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the 2014 Maidan Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Dig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s interview with Volodymyr Ishchenko&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/ukraine-w-volodymyr-ishchenko/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Ukraine’s then-president Viktor Yanukovych reneged at the last minute on a free-trade agreement with the European Union, accepting instead a different agreement with Russia. Small crowds protested in Kiev’s main square, or “maidan.” In a strange episode still shrouded in mystery — did Yanukovvych order it? was it a false flag? — the crowds were violently dispersed, a needless act of aggression that swelled the protests and eventually led to revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing years, Ukrainian politics have grown sharply polarized between a liberal and nationalist camp, boasting an uneasy alliance of West-looking neoliberals and far-right extremists; and a Russia-aligned camp that plays up Ukraine’s deep cultural, linguistic, and economic ties to the massive power to its north and east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as Ishchenko argues, this culturally inflected, identitarian hyper-polarization — spurred along by large influxes of US military aid on the one hand and Putin’s propaganda machine on the other — leaves out the vast majority of Ukrainians, who remain depoliticized, culturally bound to both Russia and Ukrainian nationalism, and faced with the economic pressures of life in a poor country that has greatly accelerated neoliberal austerity since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ishchenko argues the Left has room to break out of this impasse — though for reasons of leftist historical fragility, all that currently appears on the horizon is depoliticization and polarization on the domestic front, and saber-rattling and propaganda internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #15: Joe Biden Has Failed in His Fight Against Coronavirus, with Justin Feldman</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter15"/>
   <updated>2022-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter15</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Feldman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last January, Joe Biden entered office promising to win the war against coronavirus. Four months later, Center for Disease Control director Rachelle Wolensky announced that vaccinated Americans could take off their masks, and on July 4, Biden declared something like victory over the pandemic, telling the nation that “while the virus hasn’t been vanquished, … it no longer controls our lives, it no longer paralyzes our nation, and it’s within our power to make sure it never does so again.” In the months since that victory speech, tens of millions of Americans have been infected with the virus, and more than 250,000 have died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the extent of Delta’s pathogenicity or Omicron’s immune evasiveness were not predicted, epidemiologists have long insisted that until the rest of the world is vaccinated, new variants will keep coming. Why, then, was the Biden administration so unprepared? And why have they barely deviated from a vaccine-only response, which, though it may have made sense in January 2021, has been wholly inadequate to January 2022? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions that social epidemiologist Justin Feldman tackles in his 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jmfeldman.medium.com/a-year-in-how-has-biden-done-on-pandemic-response-88452c696f2&quot;&gt;recent overview of Biden’s pandemic response&lt;/a&gt; and in his conversation with 
. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feldman argues that, led by Jeffrey Zients — a consultant who helped the Obama administration “streamline processes [and] cut costs,” in between stints on the boards of Sirius XM and Facebook — the White House bet on avoiding politically risky non-pharmaceutical interventions — contact tracing, mass testing, temporary closures of non-essential businesses, and any policy that would irk business by impeding proftimaking — and keep the economy humming while we marched toward herd immunity. Though they lost this bet, the administration has largely refused to reverse course, even as infections soared above 800,000 each day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to’s 
interview with Justin Feldman&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bidens-pandemic-w-justin-feldman/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using state resources to fight and minimize infections, Biden has treated the socialized risks of life in a pandemic as matters of personal responsibility, and the administration has taken to lashing out at those it sees as standing in the way of a return to normalcy. Teachers are demonized for not wanting to return to schools, despite those schools being transformed into little more than holding pens for both sick and not-yet-sick children so their parents can get back to work. Those who have yet to get their first shot are treated as an undifferentiated mass of intransigent MAGA supporters — even though, Feldman writes, “the unvaccinated are largely low-income, uninsured, pregnant, incarcerated, and children” (to say nothing of the immunocompromised for whom vaccination provides insufficient protection). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By dragging their feet on distributing masks, undermining rapid tests, failing to provide better air filtration, and telling people to return to work while still potentially infectious, the administration has contributed mightily to the chaos and suffering of the last few weeks. As Feldman makes clear, these failures were not inevitable and must not be treated as such. They are failures of a Democratic administration’s policy and personnel, of individual people unable to learn from their mistakes and unwilling to prioritize people over profits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of pandemic coverage out there, of course. But you can read Feldman’s recent Medium post

   <title>Newsletter #14: Building Left Power in Disorienting Times, with Aziz Rana, Nikhil Pal Singh, and Wendy Brown</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter14"/>
   <updated>2022-04-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter14</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by William Harris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sort of times are we living through? As legal scholar Aziz Rana puts it in a blockbuster new 
Diginterview that also features fellow 
Digsuperguests Nikhil Pal Singh, a historian, and Wendy Brown, a political philosopher, we live in a moment “consumed by history.” Nostalgia suffuses our politics. Myths of a vanished world of white, male breadwinners benignly lording over devout nuclear families propel an ever-zanier series of endless culture wars. “Critical Race Theory,” trans people using bathrooms, the politics of mask-wearing and vaccine mandates — the Right has become incredibly adept at politicizing manufactured controversies to strip away or capture the institutions of representative democracy, from local school boards to the Supreme Court, the gerrymandering of electoral districts to draconian voter ID laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These particular culture wars are at once, as Singh reminds us, “ruptural,” or genuinely new political phenomena, and “continuous,” part of a long American postwar story. With this in mind, our guests try to figure out how exactly to conceive of our moment. Does the Right have a positive political project, or is it now merely destructive? How should the Left respond to a disorienting culture war terrain in which the stage seems always set by the Right? And in a time of ecological devastation, US imperial decadence, and democratic erosion, the age-old question still presents itself: how can the Left build power?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Dig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s interview with Aziz Rana, Nikhil Pal Singh, and Wendy Brown&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/interregnum-w-aziz-rana-nikhil-pal-singh-wendy-brown/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building Left institutional power requires taking stock of the existing institutional landscape. Our guests map the major institutions within the broad left-of-center field and debate which ones, if any, might allow us to push forward socialist politics. Real disagreements arise — over how much primacy to afford the labor movement, and over how the Left can organize the unorganized — and we end up without “easy answers,” as 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/nikhil_palsingh/status/1479480900094210050?cxt=HHwWhMC54ceClogpAAAA&quot;&gt;Singh wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. But two takeaways stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come away with a rare synthetic view of the present, equally attendant to the 
longue durée of neoliberalism and the insane rush of the day’s news cycle. We come away, too, with a rare sense of hope. We live in a time “consumed by history,” to quote Rana again, when the “past order has broken down, and yet we don’t really have an idea of what’s going to come next.” This can open the door to useless and even reactionary nostalgia, but it can also invite us to learn anew from the dreams and achievements of past Left movements — and to feel our own time, despite its bleakness, as up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #13: A Path Forward for Workers in Rust Belt America, with Gabriel Winant</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter13"/>
   <updated>2022-04-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter13</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Feldman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the recognition of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1937 and their 116-day strike in 1959, Pittsburgh’s steelworkers fought for — and won — health and disability insurance, pensions, consistent wage increases, and a slice of decency and dignity on the job. Sixty years later, steel is only Pittsburgh’s sixteenth largest employer, and roughly one out of every five workers in the Steel City works in health care or social assistance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That service work has eclipsed manufacturing across the Rust Belt is well-understood. Less understood is the argument at the center of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674238091&quot;&gt;Gabriel Winant’s &lt;/a&gt;: that the industrial economy 
 the care economy. Reconstructing the “social world” that Pittsburgh steel made, Winant shows that “as the industrial basis of this world began to collapse, its inhabitants … drew on the resources they had, embedded in the relationships and identities they had already built. …Their world was melted down and recast,” Winant writes, “but it was still made from the same materials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh’s economy was built and maintained through a series of compromises, which temporarily defended the economic citizenship of a mostly white and male cohort of union workers in part (but only in part) through the exclusion of large numbers of women and African Americans. Winant shows that, as manufacturing crumbled, these excluded workers found jobs in the area’s rapidly expanding network of hospitals and nursing homes — an expansion
 made possible by financialization and necessitated by the increasing health care needs of a mid-century labor force prematurely aged by the ravages of a lifetime in the mills. The low wages paid to this mostly non-union, and disproportionately Black and female, workforce have led to Pittsburgh having one of the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://pittsburghunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-Day-in-the-Neighborhood.pdf&quot;&gt;highest African-American poverty rates in&lt;/a&gt; the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond untangling the roots of the increasingly precarious, contingent, and uncertain economy of the twenty-first century, Winant suggests a possible path forward — one that does not rely on nostalgia for the mid-twentieth century’s industrial labor force. Instead, Winant offers a vision of a shared politics wherein both those receiving care 
 the essential workers providing that care unite in struggle for a more inclusive social citizenship. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #12: Money Is Inherently Political, with Stefan Eich</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter12"/>
   <updated>2022-04-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Mack Penner &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the truest believers, cryptocurrency promises utopia. Following Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, their central claim is that decentralized currency beyond the control of states and banks promises a utopian economic life beyond politics. This is, of course, entirely false — and not just in the sense that crypto actually functions as yet another instrument for financial speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-political utopian claims made on behalf of cryptocurrency, political theorist Stefan Eich argues, are rhetorical cover for what is ultimately just a recent episode in a long history of ideological battles over money, which is always political. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to’s interview with Stefan Eich&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/private-money-with-stefan-eich/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary debates over crypto can be traced back, at least, to the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s. Bretton Woods was a system of international monetary arrangements and financial regulations that included stringent capital controls and “fixed but flexible” exchange rates where currencies were pegged to the dollar and the dollar was tied to gold. This system effectively ceased to function in 1971 and formally ended in 1973 as a result of the inflation crisis. To tame that crisis,  Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker jacked interest rates sky high — a shift that, among other things, helped break the power of American unions and usher in decades’ worth of skyrocketing inequality. The “moderate” fiscal policy ushered in by Volcker lasted until the 2008 financial crisis. Within weeks of the crash, Nakamoto published the initial proposal for Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the end of Bretton Woods and 2008, intense political battles over money played out. As a precursor to crypto, Eich focuses on the proposals of neoliberal paragon Friedrich Hayek for a “denationalized” private money that would liberate money markets from the influence of states. The monetary policies that emerged after Bretton Woods, influenced by thinkers like Hayek, clearly worked in the interests of wealthy capitalist states at the forefront of neoliberalism; structural adjustment programs imposed on poorer countries by the International Monetary Fund, which made loans conditional upon their implementing neoliberal policies, proved devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leftists today should recognize the interests that are served by schemes for anti-political money, to effectively counter them. In rejecting cryptocurrency, we have an opportunity to confront the deeply unjust post-Bretton Woods order — and build a left politics of democratic money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eich’s interview is the second in a two-part series on cryptocurrency. Listen to the first episode in the series, with Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman,

   <title>Newsletter #11: The False Promises of Cryptocurrency with Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter11"/>
   <updated>2022-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Maia Silber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global market in cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of more than $2 trillion. Celebrities from Kim Kardashian to Elon Musk to Spike Lee have touted the benefits of decentralized, digital forms of money, promising that they will democratize finance by freeing ordinary investors from the tyranny of Wall Street and central banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But far from liberating them, argue journalists Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman, “crypto” distributors entrap their users in speculative gambits akin to multilevel marketing schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital asset exchanges make use of blockchain, a publicly distributed ledger that records transactions with encrypted data that cannot be retroactively altered. Some early boosters hoped that blockchain’s combination of transparency and privacy (the identities of individual users are not recorded) could be harnessed for socially beneficial means — for instance, to facilitate government or corporate whistleblowing. Mostly, though, crypto companies have exploited the technology for the creation of highly speculative markets in private money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen toThe Dig’sinterview with Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/cryptocurrency-w-edward-ongweso-jr-jacob-silverman/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbacked by governments and unattached to real commodities, the “value” of crypto derives entirely from the fluctuating demand for its artificially limited supply. Crypto promoters often advertise explicitly speculative schemes such as “pump and dumps,” where users are encouraged to rapidly buy up a currency in order to inflate its value before offloading their stash — schemes in which it is not uncommon for the organizers and some participants to have secretly bought in early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winners of such risky games are rarely ordinary users. More often, they are a small number of connected and highly capitalized individuals, some of them backed by major investment firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongweso and Silverman see crypto’s false promise of egalitarianism as one of its most pernicious aspects. In an advertisement for the digital currency machine company Coin Cloud, Spike Lee urges viewers to reject the government currency that “systematically oppresses” and join the “digital revolution.” While funk music plays, he addresses himself to the millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color, who are unbanked and underbanked — never mind that investing in an extremely volatile asset is hardly advisable for those who are financially insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like welfare privatization and the gig economy, then, crypto promises to equalize “opportunity” while removing public protections so that the already-rich can get even richer. This is no new digital utopia, argue Ongweso and Silverman, but the old story of enclosure, further dispossessing the already dispossessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first installment of our two-episode series on crypto. Next week, political theorist Stephen Eich situates crypto in the long history of political fights over money.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #10: How Neoliberalism Creates Right-Wing Reaction, with Rodrigo Nunes</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter10"/>
   <updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Mack Penner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far-right movements have proliferated across the globe, often on the strength of popular support significant enough to win elections, the relationship between neoliberalism and the politics of reaction has become an urgent problem for the Left. Decades of neoliberal governance, deeply undemocratic in their own right, have helped create an openly anti-democratic politics that is often hateful and violent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second of back-to-back episodes on Brazil (you can listen to the first, with historian Andre Pagliarini and sociologist Sabrina Fernandes, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/brazil-w-sabrina-fernandes-andre-pagliarini/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), 
’s interview with Rodrigo Nunes takes the politics of Bolsonarismo as a case study for assessing these developments. In a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/of-what-is-bolsonaro-the-name&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/a&gt; of 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicbooks.org/are-we-in-denial-about-denial/&quot;&gt;essays&lt;/a&gt; published last year, Nunes argues that core to neoliberalism’s creation of widespread right-wing reaction is a kind of “denialism.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While neoliberalism has created increasing political and economic dissatisfaction among large groups of people, that dissatisfaction has not exclusively or even primarily led to the emergence of a new anti-capitalist common sense around which left movements can readily mobilize. Instead, politicians like Jair Bolsonaro and other reactionary populists have capitalized on popular discontent and directed it towards reactionary ends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to’s interview with Rodrigo Nunes&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bolsonarismo-with-rodrigo-nunes/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The denialist sword is double-edged: people in an unconscious denial about the causes of their problems become eager consumers of conscious denial, happily supplied by reactionaries like Bolsonaro. As Nunes puts it at the conclusion of an essay in 
, denialism “seals an alliance between those gearing up for surviving in worsening conditions and an elite increasingly at ease with the idea that ‘the earth no longer has enough room for them and for everyone else.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nunes’s interview with 
 is the latest entry in a series of episodes about neoliberalism, democracy, and the social politics of the Right. Previously, political theorist Wendy Brown has 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/ruins-of-neoliberalism-with-wendy-brown/&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; her book 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cup.columbia.edu/book/in-the-ruins-of-neoliberalism/9780231193856&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about how neoliberalism has legitimized anti-democratic politics. Historian Quinn Slobodian was 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/a-history-of-neoliberalism-with-quinn-slobodian/&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; about his book 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674979529&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which traces the fear of democracy through the intellectual history of neoliberalism. And in a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/family-values-with-melinda-cooper-2/&quot;&gt;classic episode&lt;/a&gt;, sociologist Melinda Cooper talks about her book 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9781935408345/family-values&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on the symbiotic relationship between neoliberals and social conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like a general and wide-ranging introduction to the thought and practice of neoliberalism, you can hardly do better than the edited collection 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/3075-nine-lives-of-neoliberalism&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an e-version of which is available for free from Verso. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #9: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro Is a “Major Threat to Life on the Planet”</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter9"/>
   <updated>2022-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Micah Uetricht&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing Brazil from the United States, especially during the Trump years, it was hard not to be struck with a sense of déjà vu. Watching populist far-right president Jair Bolsonaro often feels similar to watching former president Donald Trump: the corruption is so unabashed and complete, the incompetence so absurd, leftists often have remind themselves not to be distracted from the actual substance of their governance, a horror show of cruelty and misery that both men have inflicted upon their respective countries and the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Brazil, these horrors have come after some of the greatest advances for the poor and working class that any society on the planet has seen in the past half century or more, carried out under wildly popular Workers Party leader and former (and possibly future) Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In 2011, historian Perry Anderson called Lula “the most successful politician of his time.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the series of events that played out in Latin America’s largest country over the next few years were dizzying: Lula’s successor Dilma Roussef was impeached in what many deemed a “constitutional coup”; Bolsonaro won the presidency, producing a cavalcade of anti-working-class, homophobic and misogynist, ecological, and public-health disasters; and Lula was imprisoned for a year and a half on bogus corruption charges, a victim of a supposed anti-corruption campaign that was later revealed to be simply a tool of right-wing political warfare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s politics can be difficult for outsiders to understand. Luckily, for this episode, we have two Brazil scholars as our guides: Andre Pagliarini, a historian at Hampden-Sydney College, columnist at 
, and author of a forthcoming book on Brazilian nationalism; and Sabrina Fernandes, a sociologist, postdoctoral fellow at the International Research Group on Authoritarianism and Counter-Strategies through the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, and lead editor for 
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to’s interview with Pagliarini and Fernandes&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/brazil-w-sabrina-fernandes-andre-pagliarini/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fernandes sums up Bolsonaro’s presidency succinctly: “He’s a major threat to life in the country and, if we consider geopolitical issues and ecological issues, to life on the planet,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode is the first of two 
 episodes on Brazil and Bolsonaro. You can listen to the next episode on Bolsonarismo with Brazilian leftist scholar Rodrigo Nunes 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bolsonarismo-with-rodrigo-nunes/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #8: Cuba’s Key Role in Fighting Apartheid in Angola Is All but Forgotten Today</title>

&lt;p&gt;The term “Cold War” is a misnomer. While open conflict never broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union directly in the roughly four decades after World War II, the two superpowers fought bloody proxy wars across the Global South, from Korea and Vietnam to Ethiopia and Southern Africa. Recent scholarship on decolonization in the twentieth century has shown that, contrary to conventional narratives which depict countries like Cuba as pawns working towards the Soviet Union’s ends in the Third World, the reality on the ground was far more complex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 
’s most recent two-part interview, Piero Gleijeses discusses this complexity in examining Cuba’s role in the Angolan War, based on extensive interviews and archival research he conducted for 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://uncpress.org/book/9781469628325/visions-of-freedom/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protracted war in Angola became the key battleground for influence in Southern Africa between the US and the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s until just before the Soviet government’s collapse in 1991. Cuba, too, deployed troops to Angola in 1975 — the country’s largest overseas military deployment in its history — at the invitation of the Angolan government, then controlled by the socialist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). This was not Cuba’s first time supporting revolutionary forces in a decolonizing African country: Cuba had provided support to the Front National de Liberation (FLN) in Algeria in the early 1960s, as well as sent troops to the Congo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on sources from US, South African, and Cuban archives, Gleijeses argues that Cuban involvement in these African conflicts was motivated, above all, by a commitment to anti-imperialism, revolutionary internationalism, and, in the case of Angola, what Fidel Castro referred to as “
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v26/n16/piero-gleijeses/a-bone-in-the-throat&quot;&gt;the most beautiful cause&lt;/a&gt;”: anti-apartheid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to 
’s two-part interview with Piero Gleijeses&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/visions-of-freedom-w-piero-gleijeses-part-1/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check out&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/visions-of-freedom-maps/&quot;&gt;these maps&lt;/a&gt;as a visual reference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having learned from their experience in the Congo, which they entered unprepared in their attempt to support revolutionary forces there, the Cubans understood the political situation in Angola far better than the Soviet Union and frequently disagreed with the Soviets on strategy and action. Gleijeses demonstrates how the Cubans did not make the same mistake again: Cuba played a crucial role in preventing US-backed apartheid South Africa from conquering Angola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 
 interview also invites a discussion on socialist internationalism today. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the idea of an international socialist project has waned. Despite periodic outcries against US imperialism, the resurgence of today’s US left has overwhelmingly focused on domestic politics. Gleijeses’s work asks some key questions for today’s leftists: What should a global socialist movement look like? And what types of material commitments and sacrifices might it take from those of us in the heart of empire?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba’s history and present are often wildly misrepresented in US popular media. For an accessible overview of Cuban history,

   <title>Newsletter #7: The Immense Possibilities at the Heart of Our Past and Present, with David Wengrow</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter7"/>
   <updated>2022-04-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter7</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by William Harris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when academia was becoming more and more hyper-specialized, the late David Graeber was a rare generalist. He was a committed activist and scholar who believed we could understand the kind of better society humans are capable of building by telling vast stories and asking daring questions about our lives together in the past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what led him to become an anthropologist. He wanted to study existing social forms in all their diversity, from&lt;a href=&quot;https://iupress.org/9780253219152/lost-people/&quot;&gt;his doctoral fieldwork in rural Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;to his polemic against&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bullshit-Jobs/David-Graeber/9781501143335&quot;&gt;the braindead hellscape of twenty-first-century&lt;/a&gt;“bullshit jobs,” while also writing expansive histories that show us how the world wasn’t always the way it is now — and therefore might be different in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the monumental&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/debt/&quot;&gt;Debt: The First 5,000 Years&lt;/a&gt;, Graeber spent much of the last decade of his life researching an even more ambitious project alongside his friend and intellectual inspiration, the archaeologist&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/david-wengrow-professor-comparative-archaeology&quot;&gt;David Wengrow&lt;/a&gt;. The fruit of that research is a new co-authored 700-page epic by Wengrow and Graeber,&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357&quot;&gt;The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity&lt;/a&gt;— and also the subject of a mind-expanding new 
episode ofThe Digguest-hosted by&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/astra-taylor/&quot;&gt;Astra Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen toThe Dig’s interview with David Wengrow&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its most sweeping, the mainstream view of human history goes something like this: we once lived in small, egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands. With the rise of agriculture, these bands gave way to complex forms of hierarchy, class structure, and bureaucracy. This is a myth, Wengrow argues. Exploring an incredible range of sources, from French Enlightenment texts to Native American folklore and understudied archaeological sites in Mexico and Ukraine, Wengrow and Graeber uncover a history of revolutionary contingency, in which slave-holding hunter-gatherer societies develop next to egalitarian ones, diverse regional social networks are replaced by the narrower social worlds of cities and nation-states, settlements full of palaces and temples are felled in favor of the large-scale construction of spacious social housing, and the seeds of the Enlightenment lie not in Europe but in the rich cultures of debate and persuasion found among Indigenous societies in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real human story, Wengrow argues, is one of immense variation in social organization — and therefore one of immense possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Reading and Listening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous tributes to David Graeber written in the year since his death, all testifying to his brilliance, warmth, and importance to left thought.

   <title>Newsletter #6: US Workers Are Pissed Off and Striking Back</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter6"/>
   <updated>2022-04-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Michal Schatz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the United States in the middle of a strike wave? The question saturated news and social media throughout October, as US workers from disparate industries across the country did something very few workers have done in recent years: walked off the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t get too far ahead of ourselves in examining these walkoffs: relative to its historical corollaries like the Great Depression–era strikes that established the labor movement as we know it, or even the recent teachers strikes that kicked off in 2018, today’s strike wave is miniscule. Decades of neoliberal policies have gutted organized labor’s power and weakened workers’ strike muscles. But as Alex Press, Victor Bouzi, and Jonah Furman emphasize in this week’sDigepisode, the industrial actions sweeping the United States indicate a shift in workers’ sense of their own power.The urgent task for both union members and the Left is to understand what has led to this renewed worker confidence — and how to harness it to rebuild the labor movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen toThe Dig’sinterview with Alex Press, Victor Bouzi, and Jonah Furman&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/striketober/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Striketober” may be over, but the labor upsurge that kicked off last month isn’t: UAW members at John Deere shocked their management and union leaders when they&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.labornotes.org/2021/11/well-never-be-position-again-striking-deere-workers-hold-out-better-deal&quot;&gt;rejected a second tentative contract agreement&lt;/a&gt;on November 2; Kellogg’s workers are in their&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/kelloggs-strike-bctgm-union-tiered-contracts&quot;&gt;second month of striking&lt;/a&gt;; and over 30,000 workers at Kaiser are&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/11/kaiser-alliance-health-care-unions-two-tier-strike&quot;&gt;on the brink of a strike&lt;/a&gt;. As Gabriel Winant and Jonah Furman&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2021/10/17/john-deere-strike-labor-market/&quot;&gt;recently highlighted inThe Intercept&lt;/a&gt;, workers in entertainment, manufacturing, the food industry, and beyond are no longer willing to work exorbitant hours for minimal pay while their companies’ profits skyrocket. For John Deere, Kaiser, and Kellogg’s workers, today’s labor demands are not simply about immediate material gains, but about correcting neoliberal policies like two-tier wage systems that have weakened unions for three decades and made compensation worse for workers across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re far from any credible declaration of unions’ revitalization. But if labor is going to rebuild power, it will take much more of the kind of militant action we’ve seen in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview is the latest addition toThe Dig’s extensive archive of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/labor-movement/&quot;&gt;labor interviews&lt;/a&gt;. As&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/labor-beat-reporting-newspapers-journalism-unions&quot;&gt;Alex Press pointed out&lt;/a&gt;inJacobin, labor reporting largely disappeared from local and national media during the 1990s and 2000. But it has slowly been rebuilt in recent years, and the current strike surge has benefited from detailed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonah Furman has provided excellent coverage of the ongoing John Deere strike on&lt;a href=&quot;https://whogetsthebird.substack.com/&quot;&gt;his SubstackWho Gets the Bird?&lt;/a&gt;and forLabor Notes, most recently writing about how&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.labornotes.org/2021/11/well-never-be-position-again-striking-deere-workers-hold-out-better-deal&quot;&gt;workers forced Deere management back to the table&lt;/a&gt;. ForJacobin, Alex Press has written extensively about the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees’ (IATSE) ongoing negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), showing that even before Halyna Hutchins was horrifically killed on the set of Rust&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/10/halyna-hutchins-shooting-rust-iatse-alec-baldwin&quot;&gt;due to poor labor conditions&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/10/iatse-television-film-industry-union-strike-rank-and-file-overwork&quot;&gt;many members were unsatisfied&lt;/a&gt;with the terms of AMPTP’s contract proposal. And inThe Nation, Dave Leshtz recently&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/john-deere-strike-update/&quot;&gt;contextualized Deere workers’ fight in Iowa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #5: Desire Is Political, with Amia Srinivasan</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter5"/>
   <updated>2022-04-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter5</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Maia Silber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversations about the politics of sex often focus on the presence or absence of consent. For feminist philosopher Amia Srinivasan, this is a profoundly inadequate framework — one that leaves us ill-prepared to interrogate the power dynamics that shape even the sex we freely choose, and suggests carceral remedies likely to harm society’s most vulnerable members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for alternatives, Srinivasan’s 
The Right to Sex: Feminism in the Twenty-First Centuryreaches back to the “sex wars” of the 1970s, when feminists fiercely debated how power informs our desires. In those debates, she often finds more questions than answers. Can we treat sex as political without subjecting ourselves and others to an authoritarian moralism? Can we reject the sexual shaming so often weaponized against women, queer, and gender non-conforming people without succumbing to the fantasy that our desires are wholly natural?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging conversation on 
The Dig,Srinivasan brings these questions to bear on contemporary debates about sex on college campuses, pornography, and sex work. She argues, for instance, against critics who claim that teachers who enter consensual relationships with students don’t deserve our censure, while insisting that institutional responses do more to protect universities from liability than young people from abuse. She urges us to take seriously the power of pornography to shape not only sexual actions but also sexual affects and urges in harmful ways, even while recognizing the medium’s potential for inspiring radical modes of pleasure and sexual agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Dig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s interview with Amia Srinivasan&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/the-right-to-sex-with-amia-srinivasan/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The titular essay in 
The Right to Sexcontroversially examines the claims of “incel” (involuntarily celibate) men to sexual entitlement. While Srinivasan insists that there is no right to sex, she takes seriously incels’ contention that sexual attraction is distributed unequally along hierarchies of race, class, and conventional attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incels hypocritically lament the ways these hierarchies harm them even while they subscribe to their valorization of certain kinds of bodies: the rich, thin, white women they call “Stacys.” Srinivasan thinks that we can take inspiration instead from queer and Black women who have asked us to critically interrogate who and how we desire. For Srinivasan, this isn’t about repression — it’s about openness to the forms of sex and love that are blocked by our current power structures.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #4: The Long, Disastrous History of US Intervention in Afghanistan, with Tariq Ali</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter4"/>

&lt;p&gt;“What is most important to the history of the world[:] The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet Empire? A few crazed Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?” former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski asked rhetorically in a 1998 interview. He was justifying the United States’ partnership with religious reactionaries, which helped lead the Soviets to overextend themselves financially and militarily, and hastened the collapse of America’s rival hegemon. Absent from Brzezinski’s musing was any mention of the Afghan people themselves. Whether in 1979, 1998, 2001, or 2021, Afghans are ignored by US-policymakers and media, trudged out only when their suffering can be used as a cudgel against those who oppose war and occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a collection of essays written over four decades, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/3939-the-forty-year-war-in-afghanistan&quot;&gt;The Forty-Year War in Afghanistan: A Chronicle Foretold&lt;/a&gt; (Verso, November), Tariq Ali reconstructs the history of American intervention in  Afghanistan. Beginning with the Soviet invasion in 1979, the United States — with the help of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan — mobilized an international network of anti-Soviet Islamic fighters. In doing so, the U.S. and its Middle Eastern allies helped create a generation of militants whose “deracinated fanaticism” helped them to emerge from the second Afghan Civil War (1992-1996) as the dominant power in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s rise was the unintended consequence of America’s Cold War foreign policy: decades of funding, training, and propping up right-wing forces throughout the world. Five years after the Taliban captured Kabul, they were swept out of power by the United States and its allies. What began as a war of revenge, a punishment for having harbored Osama Bin Laden — lasted twenty years, ending with the collapse of the Afghan National Security Forces and the Taliban’s retaking of Kabul on August 15, 2021. In the interim, a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll&quot;&gt;quarter of a million people lost their lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, and 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2020/Displacement_Vine%20et%20al_Costs%20of%20War%202020%2009%2008.pdf&quot;&gt;some nine million Pakistanis and Afghans have been displaced&lt;/a&gt; by the War on Terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ali’s essays illustrate how the Afghan people have borne the costs of imperialistic hubris, Cold War rivalry, and America’s post-9/11 need for vengeance. Throughout, the reader is reminded of a basic point that eludes so many journalists and politicians: the crises facing Afghanistan today are the product of decades of policies which prioritized the political needs of U.S. elites over the safety, security, and independence of the Afghan people.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #3: Imagining Utopia in a Time of Climate Disaster with Kim Stanley Robinson</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter3"/>
   <updated>2022-04-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By William Harris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you’ve seen the signs, planted across the liberal meadows of our nation’s lawns with a solemn pledge: “In this house, we believe: science is real.” Framed by this oath, science becomes an apolitical set of facts blindly assented to — which then easily translates into yet more grist for the neverending culture war between rational Democrats and troglodytic Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should today’s Left approach science? Few approach this question as thoughtfully as legendary science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson, hailed by the 
New Yorkeras perhaps 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-greatest-political-novelist&quot;&gt;“our greatest political novelist,”&lt;/a&gt; author of many books — from the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/ZMS/mars-trilogy&quot;&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; trilogy to 2019’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/kim-stanley-robinson/the-ministry-for-the-future/9780316300162/&quot;&gt;Ministry for the Future&lt;/a&gt;—and our guest on a provocative new episode of 
The Dighosted by pod-comrade and Berkeley sociologist Daniel Aldana Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Robinson, science is a utopian project that the Left should claim. A “modest” way of knowing the world, importantly available to specialists but also to all of us, science lives out an always-incomplete story full of dynamic adaptation, democratic debate, and messy engagement with the material world. If science has historically been a project shot through by warring interests — too often colonial and corporate — one of these competing interests has been the idealist, Left-aligned objective of improving the world for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinson comes to these reflections as a novelist who’s spent his career telling stories that entwine ecology and social justice. We live amid climate disaster; for science, that means that now is a time when, in considering technological fixes to climate change, “it all has to be put on the table.” Controversially, he insists, that means rethinking ecological and political approaches from geo-engineering to nuclear energy to Green New Deal-prompted quantitative easing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinson’s broad-tent openness to a range of scientific possibilities to save our planet also comes from his experience as a novelist. His novels play out possible futures and dramatize a range of leftist and scientific debates, giving narrative shape to our most pressing ecological and political questions. Amid a growing body of criticism indicting contemporary literature for its failure to come to imaginative terms with ecological disaster — from Amitav Ghosh’s 2016 book 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html&quot;&gt;The Great Derangement&lt;/a&gt; to Rithika Ramamurthy’s recent takedown of the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedriftmag.com/climate-anxiety/&quot;&gt;“Climate Anxiety Novel”&lt;/a&gt; — Robinson’s work stands out as compellingly original approaches to possible climate futures. His latest epic 
Ministry for the Future imagines how a plausible “best-case scenario” under climate change future might come about, raising difficult questions of left ecological politics that he discusses with Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #2: Occupy Paved the Way for Today’s Reborn Left</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter2"/>
   <updated>2022-04-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Mia Schatz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard today to remember the sense of desolation that plagued the American left a decade ago. Demoralized, disempowered, disorganized, the Left seemed to have no answer to the 2008 housing market crash and the Great Recession — until Occupy Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the movement only lasted two months, Occupy left its mark on American politics, putting the potential for a meaningful left movement back on the map. In the years since, many participants have argued that Occupy failed: its horizontal structures didn’t work; it had no actionable demands; it was too white, too affluent, and unable to put a real dent in finance capital’s power. And yet, as Astra Taylor points out in this week’s episode of 
The Dig, Occupy reframed American political discourse around class, laying the groundwork for the highly effective messaging of Bernie Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, and compelled both veteran and budding organizers to rethink a problem the Left had struggled with for years: power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Occupy faded, hundreds of former occupiers from across the country joined or formed organizations focused on housing, debt, healthcare, and climate change. Today, there is a growing American left energized not only by organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America and Black Lives Matter and stirrings in key parts of the labor movement, but also by left-aligned elected officials at national, state, and local levels who are challenging the power of capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupy offered critical lessons about how a political movement can build power without losing sight of its core principles. If, as Astra argues in this week’s interview, the Left of a decade ago was allergic to power and electoral politics, today’s Left has found the antidote in strong, well-organized institutions that are increasingly capable of holding its leaders accountable. These are essential questions that are still at the heart of left organizing today — and will only become more urgent as the post-Occupy left keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to 
The Dig’s interview with Astra Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/occupy-at-10-with-astra-taylor/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupy’s recent tenth anniversary inspired a wave of reflections and analyses. During Occupy, media attention focused heavily on the demographic composition of occupiers. As Dan and Astra discuss, labor scholars Ruth Milkman, Penny Lewis, and Stephanie Luce 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.sps.cuny.edu/filestore/1/5/7/1_a05051d2117901d/1571_92f562221b8041e.pdf&quot;&gt;interviewed occupiers on the ground at the New York occupation in Zuccotti Park&lt;/a&gt;. Sarah Jaffe, host of 
Dissent’s 
Belabored podcast, recently 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/belabored-the-legacy-of-occupy-wall-street&quot;&gt;interviewed Ruth Milkman and Nastaran Mohit&lt;/a&gt;, an organizer and one of the study’s interviewers, about their reflections on the movement a decade on. For 
Jacobin, Doug Singsen reminds us of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/occupy-wall-street-ows-zuccotti-park-nyc-labor-movement-unions-collaboration&quot;&gt;unions’ critical and often underplayed role&lt;/a&gt; in various OWS occupations across the country, while Ross Barkan argues the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/occupy-wall-street-new-york-city-dsa-bloomberg-cuomo&quot;&gt;media was too quick to deem Occupy a failure&lt;/a&gt;.And questions still linger about Occupy’s most influential political currents. Former occupier and current Pennsylvania State Senator Nikil Saval and 
Intercept columnist Natasha Lennard recently discussed 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/occupy-socialist-anarchist/&quot;&gt;whether Occupy was more socialist or anarchist in nature&lt;/a&gt; in 
The Nation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Newsletter #1: The War on Terror Made Our World</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//newsletter1"/>
   <updated>2022-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/newsletter1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Micah Uetricht&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years since September 11, 2001, the War on Terror’s catastrophic effects can’t be overstated. Hundreds of thousands (at least) in the Middle East are dead; trillions have been funneled to the military-industrial complex; our already desiccated democratic institutions have been further weakened; a Pandora’s box of barbarous reactionary currents have been unleashed in the United States and abroad. Our world has been grotesquely deformed by the War on Terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet somehow, that war receives scant attention these days. Little of the voluminous mainstream discourse on the rise of Donald Trump mentions it. Even Bernie Sanders did not make opposition to the War on Terror central to his presidential campaigns. And when the war does grab headlines, as during Joe Biden’s recent pullout from Afghanistan, the obvious lesson — that the war cannot be won — escapes mainstream pundits. A grinding, decades-long, amorphously defined global military campaign with disastrous consequences and no real end in sight has been largely flushed down the memory hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes Spencer Ackerman’s new book 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622555/reign-of-terror-by-spencer-ackerman/&quot;&gt;Reign of Terror: How the 9/11 Era Destabilized America and Produced Trump&lt;/a&gt; (Viking) essential reading. Ackerman, a longtime national security reporter who writes the Substack “
&lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/profile/2576701-spencer-ackerman&quot;&gt;Forever Wars&lt;/a&gt;” and won a Pulitzer at the 
Guardian for his reporting on the Edward Snowden revelations, traces the violence and toxicity unleashed by the twenty-year War on Terror: nativism, Islamophobia, erosion of civil liberties, militarization of police powers at home, indefinite detention abroad, torture, expansion of “anti-terrorist” military action far beyond the Middle East, the roles played by a bloodthirsty Republican Party convinced of its ability and right to reshape the world through violence and a Democratic Party that shamefully capitulates to the GOP’s framing of the war, the successful harvesting of the worst of these developments by Donald Trump, and much more. He discusses all of this in a three-part conversation with 
The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to part one of the War on Terror series&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/war-on-terror-w-spencer-ackerman-part-1/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, part two&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/war-on-terror-w-spencer-ackerman-part-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and part three&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/war-on-terror-w-spencer-ackerman-part-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re known for extended conversations on politics, but this 
Dig series with Spencer Ackerman goes even deeper than usual. That’s because we can’t understand the United States today — its cruelties abroad, the rot it has accelerated at home, its normalization of the illegal and immoral in the name of national security — without understanding the War on Terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackerman’s book is a crucial starting point, but the twenty-year anniversary of September 11, 2001 has brought numerous retrospectives on the War on Terror. Leftists, of course, have long denounced the war and did so again on the anniversary: Branko Marcetic writes for 
Jacobinabout how 9/11 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/september-11-anniversary-war-terror-bin-laden&quot;&gt;could have provided an opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to reflect on blowback to US imperialism but was squandered, and the 
Nation’s September 20/27 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/issue/september-20-27-2021-issue/&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the spectacular failures of the War on Terror, including the explosion of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/muslim-american-race/&quot;&gt;Islamophobia at home&lt;/a&gt; and the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/gitmo-detainees-uae/&quot;&gt;hellish experiences&lt;/a&gt; of former Guantanamo detainees. Predictably, mainstream outlets were more ambivalent, but some liberal columnists like the 
New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/opinion/how-9-11-turned-america-into-a-half-crazed-fading-power.html&quot;&gt;denounced&lt;/a&gt; the war stridently.&lt;/p&gt;

The Digital Party: Political Organisation and Online Democracy. How does the promise of direct digital democracy obscure how leaders are made more powerful and less accountable? Examples from Italy (Five Star Movement) and Spain (Podemos). How does the failure to incorporate people into rooted forms of political organization undermine the left’s power, coherence, and durability?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Denvir:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no simple task for a poor country to escape its place in the world system. Global South countries like Ecuador, once known as Third World countries, have been consigned since colonial times to exporting primary commodities, from sugar and silver and bananas to oil and copper and low-wage manufactured goods, while capitalists in wealthy countries like the US control the most profitable top of the value chain. Not that First World capitalists share their spoils with First World workers—at least not since the neoliberal turn. Just as the capitalist system relies on a domestic order of class domination, within which capitalists exploit workers, it also fixes different countries in particular places in the global economic order. Ecuador, exporting goods like bananas and oil, is near the bottom. Those unequal domestic class and also racial orders are fundamentally linked to the unequal world system. Keeping that order in place is one reason that capitalism and imperialism go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I recently discussed with Toby Chow and Jake Warner, it’s why the US is so furious about China breaking the so-called ‘rules’’ of the global economy. Latin America’s last era of left governments, the so-called ‘Pink Tide’ that began with Hugo Chávez’s 1998 election in Venezuela, accomplished major achievements in dramatically reducing poverty and including the excluded at the heart of revitalized democratic societies. But they were unable to escape their place in the world system, and also, to a degree that might be surprising, given all the scaremongering over creeping communism, they were constrained in their ability to remake domestic class orders. The case of Ecuador is a case in point. Rafael Correa, who took office in 2007, joined fellow Pink Tide presidents in taking advantage of soaring prices for commodities like oil, driven by China’s breakneck industrialization to ramp up social spending. When that commodity boom went bust in 2014, the fiscal basis for left governments across Latin America evaporated. But in Ecuador, conflict over the export-dependent model emerged earlier, at the commodity boom’s height. Correa’s push to create a large-scale mining sector and to expand oil drilling prompted fierce resistance from Ecuadorian social movements, led by the CONAIE, the legendary national indigenous federation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what my guest today, Thea Riofrancos, discusses in her new book,Resource Radicals: From Petronationalism to Post-Extractivism in Ecuador. The CONAIE, at its height the most powerful social movement in the Americas, had led the resistance to neoliberalism that took off in the 1990s, laying the groundwork for Correa’s election. At the height of the struggle against neoliberalism, CONAIE and social movements embraced what Thea calls “radical resource nationalism,” the demand that the exploitation of natural resources and the benefits derived from them be controlled by the people through a democratic state. But soon after Correa took office, the anti-neoliberal alliance fractured. Correa saw large-scale mining for gold and copper as a way to generate resources to reduce poverty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Indigenous people and small-scale farmers, campesinos, however, viewed mining as a threat to their land, water, and territory. It wasn’t just that Correa had betrayed radical resource nationalism by continuing to allow foreign corporations to dominate mining and oil. Social movements attacked Correa’s continuation of the very extractive model, demanding an Ecuador without large-scale mining and indeed without any extraction at all. But social movements like CONAIE were unable to replicate the size and scope of their past mobilizations against neoliberalism. Many who might have joined the CONAIE in the past welcomed Correa’s redirection of commodity boom spending to the poor majority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the rights of Indigenous communities and nature came into conflict with economic uplift for the majority, an impossible situation for a left that is charged with securing economic justice for people and also a habitable planet upon which people can live. This intra-left fight became incredibly bitter and polarized, and it raised key dilemmas for left social movements and left governments. Problems that are all the more obvious with climate change wreaking its most lethal and disruptive havoc on the world’s poor, painfully demonstrating that there can be no economic justice without ecological balance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thea Riofrancos is a professor of political science at Providence College and a Radcliffe Institute Fellow. She serves on DSA’s Green New Deal campaign committee and is a co-author ofA Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal, and the author ofResource Radicals: From Petronationalism to Post-Extractivism in Ecuador. Thea is the Dig’s senior advisor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
Why, in your mid-twenties in 2007, did you and I decide to move to Ecuador, and how did what we observed there help shape this book that you have written?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thea Riofrancos:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In 2007, as you said, we decided to move to South America, and our choice of Ecuador was a bit arbitrary. It was eliminating countries that we had already spent a lot of time in, and we had a list of a few, and among them we chose Ecuador because it was a place where a left-wing government had just come to power in this broader moment that scholars call the Pink Tide, which was a sweep of left-wing governments across the continent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years prior, both of us had been involved in what’s called Latin America solidarity politics — involved in visiting Latin America and coming into direct contact with social movements, and receiving delegations from social movements and labor unions in Latin America. This solidarity politics comes out of the late 1970s and 1980s, during Reagan’s dirty wars, where there was the emergence of the solidarity movement in the US, but it had shifted and changed, especially with the arrival of left-wing governments to power, starting with Hugo Chávez in 1999. As solidarity activists, we found ourselves in the interesting position of being in solidarity both with movements, with popular movements, workers’ movements, indigenous movements, women’s movements—but also with nascent left-wing governments who found themselves very much under the watch of empire, and were concerned about how imperial powers might respond to them. So we were in that interesting mix of solidarity politics when we decided to move to Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Ecuador, I think what we both learned right away—we knew already that the arrival to power of the left would be complicated, for the reasons I’ve just said. They’re arriving to power in a context of imperialism, and know that they’re under threat both from the domestic ruling class and from foreign powers. But it was complex in an additional way, which goes back to what I was just saying about movements and governments: how would popular movements interact with the governments that they had helped bring to power? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When left governments come to power anywhere in the world, social movements and labor movements face this question: Are we in strict alliance with the government? Are we defending the government against its enemies and our enemies? Are we holding the government accountable to its promises? Are we pushing the government to radicalize? I would say that all of those options were explored and enacted in different ways and in different contexts of left-wing rule in Latin America at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ecuador was unique in a way, because right from the beginning, conflict emerged between movements that had critically supported—and I mean critical in both senses of the term; they were critical in that they were crucial to the rise of Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador who had just been recently elected when we arrived, but they were also critical in the other sense of the word, which is that they did not lose their critical faculties once he came to power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had this rise of the left to power after a long period of movement mobilization, which we’ll talk about a lot in this interview, and when you and I arrived in Ecuador, those movements were already in a process of critiquing and shortly thereafter coming into actual opposition with the government. As solidarity activists and, later on, myself as a scholar, that is exactly what was interesting but also fraught. How do I analyze intra-left conflict in a way that is objective but also generous and true to those principles of solidarity and internationalism that brought us to Ecuador in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that was quite interesting about Ecuador, in addition to the fact that conflict between movements and a left government started quite quickly after the left assumed power, was what the conflict was about. The conflict really hinged on the issues of resource extraction, socio-environmental contract around extraction, and indigenous territory sovereignty and self-determination. Those were the main points of conflict, not only between the state and movements, but also even within different factions of the state itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And in terms of movements, Ecuador was and is home to the indigenous federation CONAIE, the most powerful indigenous movement in the Americas at certain moments and perhaps the most powerful social movement in Latin America at certain movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. Scholars have referred to the CONAIE at its moment of supreme strength in the 1990s especially as the most powerful movement in its mobilizing capacity and in its ability to topple multiple governments in Ecuador, as the most powerful movement in the hemisphere. It was a force to be contended with. By the time that Correa came to power, the movement had to some extent weakened, but was still an extremely important force, and re-emerged as an important articulator of popular protests under the Correa administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You’re right about this debate under Correa, who was president from 2007 through 2017—that it “emerged in a regional context characterized by two processes: the electoral success of leftist governments and a sustained commodity boom.” Let’s start with the context of the rise of left governments in the Pink Tide in Latin America. Ecuador is one of the Pink Tide countries that has received the least attention in the US. What do Pink Tide leaders mean by what they called “socialism for the 21st century”? And where did Correa’s government fit into this broader set of leaders and governments that included Lula in Brazil, Chávez in Venezuela, Morales in Bolivia, Kirchner in Argentina, Vázquez in Uruguay? At the time at least, there was this conventional dichotomy drawn between good and bad, radical and moderate leftist governments in Latin America, but you argue that such categories don’t really hold up upon closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 To answer this question, I want to set the context a little bit more and pick up with some of the things I was saying previously—emphasizing to listeners less familiar with Latin American politics how world-historic (important for the whole planetary conjuncture) the coming-to-power of so many left-wing governments at once was. It’s quite historically unusual. I think the only kind of parallel to make is the simultaneous rise of many social-democratic governments in Europe, but the rise of so many leftist governments in the Global South, in that context of empire, makes it additionally unique. Just to put it in perspective, in I think 2009 or 2010—what is the height of the Pink Tide—two-thirds of Latin Americans lived under left-of-center or more radically left-wing governments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very widespread phenomenon of the left coming to power, and not only is it in terms of numbers or the number of countries or governments as you listed, but it’s also important in terms of the rupture that it marked. Prior to the Pink Tide, you had decades of neoliberal governments that had various shades of ideology, but all of them were committed to a neoliberal program. That neoliberal program is precisely what left-wing governments came to power to, in their own words, contest and dismantle, very much in response to, again, decades of social mobilization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the democratically-elected neoliberal governments, there were dictatorships. One of the fascinating things about Latin America is this pendulum swing between different political paradigms and regime types in short periods of time—really dramatic shifts. You have a bunch of left-wing governments coming to power, and you mentioned several of them. Oftentimes scholars analyze these governments as good versus bad left. This is in academic journals and in the pages of the New York Times—it’s a common way to describe them. Generally, ‘bad left’ was the more radical left—that was how the scholars defined it, and the ‘good left’ was the more pragmatic left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these categories are extremely unhelpful. First and foremost, they’re not analytic categories; they’re normative categories, and they’re normative categories from a certain perspective, gazing on the Global South and saying, “What is the right and wrong path for governments in the Global South to take?” They immediately betray their normative positions, so I think they’re suspect for that reason. Let’s go to the figure of Correa in particular. Correa is classified as the ‘bad left,’ along with, generally, Morales and Chávez. Some of that is based on his rhetoric, which reproduces the tropes of Latin American leftism. It’s anti-imperialist, it’s about the state reasserting its power, it’s about meeting social needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And anti-imperialist being anti-US imperialism, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. That is why scholars have classified him as ‘radical.’ But on the other hand, Correa, unlike Morales, and unlike Lula (who is characterized as ‘good left’) doesn’t come from a social movement or labor background. He is a technocrat; he is an economist; he had previously served as a finance minister under another government. He is left wing; I am not doubting his left-wing credentials, although a lot of my book is about conflicts over how we define the left. But I think I would place him firmly on the left. He is a technocratic leftist with no history of social movement activity, and in no way is an organic intellectual leader like Morales was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatically, these categories break down, because it would actually be more useful, as I think better scholars have done, to analyze how these leaders came to power; what their trajectories were, autobiographically; to analyze the trajectory of the political parties that they led. Were these parties grounded and rooted in social movements? Were these parties created as electoral vehicles in order to bring a particular leader to the ballot-box? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I’ll say on this granular point—the other big reason that I really dislike these broad generic labels, to label entire countries as good or bad left—is that in Ecuador, there was a tremendous amount of contention, conflict, also at times collaboration between movement and state actors. To label the entire country under one moniker really effaces the fact that what the left’s project was was up for debate. How to implement leftism in the context of the Global South under the thumb of empire was under debate. What tactics to use vis-à-vis a domestic ruling class that so recently had been politically hegemonic in the neoliberal period was up for question. And so these labels don’t do justice to the more interesting thing, which is the internal tensions, dilemmas, and tradeoffs that marked the period of left rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Your book is about this intra-left conflict over mining that was really a central political conflict throughout Correa’s time in office. To what extent did these sorts of conflict over resource extraction emerge in other Pink Tide countries, and to the extent that they did not, why not? There are all of these different factors at play. Ecuador had a powerful indigenous movement, in contrast to, say, Venezuela, but Bolivia also had a massive indigenous movement. Environmental conflict was a feature, but I don’t think a defining thing, of Morales’s conflict with his base. Was Ecuador’s experience exemplary or unique, or was it more of an omen, foreshadowing the kind of problems that any kind of left government to deal with ecological crisis will face?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think it’s both exemplary and unique, but let me zoom out a bit and talk about the commodity boom for a moment. That was the other big process that you mentioned in your prior question. Two processes mark the political-economic conjuncture that I’m looking at in my book. On the one hand is the rise of the left to power, and all of the interesting questions and dilemmas that that posed, as I just discussed. That was a regional context. The other context is a global context. We can see that countries are nested in different political-economic scales. And the global context, economically, was marked by the commodity boom. That is an economic period, an economic cycle, that starts in roughly 2000 and ends in roughly 2014. It was driven primarily by China’s rapid industrialization, but also by the industrialization of other so-called emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a sudden increase in demand for raw materials. Why? Because in order to industrialize, in order to manufacture goods, goods are made from raw materials that come from the earth. So all of the prices for those raw materials skyrocketed because there was so much demand for them on the global market. And what’s interesting about Latin America is that it is, as we’ll again discuss throughout this interview, a commodity and export-dependent region economically. So many of those goods are extracted or harvested in Latin America, and so at the same time that the left came to power, there was a tremendous flow of economic resources into state coffers because all of these governments ruled over national economies that exported these resources. And in Ecuador, particularly, the effects of the commodity boom were felt through a dramatic increase in oil prices. There was also a dramatic increase in mineral prices, which is part of what incentivized the Correa government to finally exploit these mineral reserves that had been untapped in Ecuador for its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why then, in this context of left-wing power and the commodity boom, do we get such intense conflict over extraction and, in fact, emergence of militant anti-extractive movements, primarily based in the indigenous movement and in allied radical environmental groups? Why in Ecuador? You nicely lay out that there can be different causes for this. One of those causes you mentioned is a long history of indigenous mobilization in Ecuador. I’ve already said that the CONAIE—the national indigenous federation—was one of the most powerful social movements in the continent, and a lot of what it had mobilized around for a long time were the issues of land, of territory, and also the threats, especially in the Amazon, of resources extraction to indigenous territorial rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think what sets Ecuador apart from Bolivia is a couple of things. There was the addition of a completely new extractive sector in Ecuador. I said that Ecuador had long been an oil-producing state, and oil was one of the commodities that saw its prices increase a lot. Ecuador had exported oil since the early 1970s, but Correa’s gambit to diversify the portfolio of extractive sectors into large-scale copper and gold mining was a real game-changer. Scholars have noted across the world that when governments and corporations seek to exploit extractive sectors that are new in the national economic context, they expose ecosystems, territories, and peoples not previously in touch with extractive sectors to the fate of extraction, which involves environmental pollution, contamination, dispossession, threats to existing livelihoods. So introducing a new extractive sector really changes the politics of extraction. It makes extraction salient in a new way, compared to more institutionalized extractive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing that sets Ecuador apart is its very strong indigenous movement with links to the environmentalist movement. We also have a new extractive sector, which makes extraction more contentious oftentimes; and in addition, Ecuador, more than Bolivia, is really tied to the boom-and-bust global cycle of the commodity boom, and tied to the Chinese economy. A lot of what Bolivia exports, primarily gas, is more regional in its economic ambit. As a result, China’s rapid industrialization phase coming to a close didn’t as directly affect Bolivia’s economic fortunes, and we can actually see that in that Bolivia’s gas exports were less tied to this global boom and bust cycle, and the fact that the economic fortunes of Morales’s government were much better than those of Correa’s or Chávez’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And although Morales entered into a pretty major crisis and suffered a coup, MAS is now back in power as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. But that was a delayed response. Ultimately, Bolivia does feel the effects of global economic downturns, but it wasn’t as immediately affected by the close of China’s rapid industrialization period, as Ecuador was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This is a key paradox with the commodity boom. It operated within this pre-existing world system that marginalized countries like Ecuador, while at the same time, it created the fiscal basis for the Pink Tide’s left rule. But it ultimately helped send the Pink Tide into crisis. Was it the main cause of the Pink Tide’s crisis and decline, or were there other factors at play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There were other factors at play, but I think that you can’t just ignore the fact of timing. Across the region, these various Pink Tide governments, starting in around 2014, really entered into serious political difficulties, and there were different reasons and conjunctures in each case. There were different balances of class and political power. There were different relationships to social movements and questions over how democratic the relationship between the state and movements was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to simplify that too much, but I do want to say that the end of the commodity boom in 2014 sets into motion a series of insurmountable economic difficulties for these governments, and we have to understand that the political power and popularity of these governments was closely tied to their ability to spend massively on social services and public infrastructures, which helped lift up dramatically people’s life chances, developmental outcomes, employment possibilities, possibilities for forms of local economic development. Their ability to keep winning elections was closely tied to the economic scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the end of the period of the commodity boom, there weren’t the fiscal resources in place in most cases. The World Bank lauded Bolivia’s macroeconomic management and their ability to smooth out some of those boom-bust cycles with forms of state saving and subsequent investment. But in general, their fates hinged on their ability to meet people’s needs, because they came into power responding to decades of social movements demanding that those needs be met, and they promised upon coming to power that they would, and they were re-elected multiple times. As you said, Correa was ten years in power. They stayed in power because of their ability to deliver on promises, and I think it can’t be understated how much the commodity boom undermined that possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that these governments’ economic fates were so tied to the global economic scene was because of the prior period of neoliberalism. These governments didn’t come to power out of nowhere, or in a vacuum. They came to power in the thick of history, and in the prior decades of history there had been more and more concerted attempts by governing elites, by international financial institutions and by corporations and the domestic ruling classes to deeply integrate Latin American economies into the global economy, to deregulate, to liberalize markets, to become more expert-oriented, to lease and sell concessions for mining, oil, and other extractive projects to foreign companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the time the left came to power, Latin America had a different relationship to the global economy. It was rather seamlessly integrated into those global markets and deeply dependent on them for its economic fate. The Pink Tide couldn’t have immediately undone that relationship between the regional, national, and global, but it also didn’t really try to, because the very understandable incentive or temptation to make good use immediately of all of these economic resources flowing into their state coffers because of how well their exports were doing in global markets was too great. They had an immediate fiscal basis in order to address social needs of their populations, and they did renegotiate contracts with foreign firms. Sometimes this is simplified and called ‘resource nationalism’ in a simplistic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, they didn’t nationalize extractive firms or expropriate them. But they did forcefully renegotiate contracts with oil companies, mining companies, soy companies, gas companies, and with a strong democratic mandate behind them, in order to increase the taxes and royalties that are paid to the state. So they basically made the gamble to stay in the global economy, and to renegotiate contracts so terms are better for the state and for the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But the commodity boom will also allow left governments to boost social spending without radically confronting their domestic class system, something also lost in the radical rhetoric of Correa or Chávez, which meant that when the commodity boom went bust, the upper class was very much still there in a powerful economic position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The other reason that ‘resource rents,’ as they’re called technically, are politically easy forms of financing social programs and public works is not just because the prices were high for the commodity, so a lot of money was coming in. They also avoided the question of deeper forms of class conflict, because if you have oil, mining, or gas money coming in, you can defer—punt into the future—the question of expropriating property of the wealthy. Or, less dramatically but equally challenging in Latin America, there’s the question of taxing the rich more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing that Latin America has very low taxation rates; that is because the ruling class, from the period of independence, has been unwilling to support the broader masses through taxation. These governments, for the most part, did not expropriate property or dramatically redistribute land. There were various attempts at land reform, and some of them were moderately successful, like in Bolivia—but there was not massive redistribution, so land tenure remains deeply unequal. Though Correa did make the tax program more progressive, and he should be lauded for that, some of his attempts to make it even more progressive—for example, with an inheritance tax—the right wing came out in the streets, and he withdrew it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who hasn’t witnessed them in Latin America, elite protests are very strange spectacles. They came out in force, and Correa withdrew it. He had implemented some other tax reform that was positive, but he didn’t implement all the tax reforms that he wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Before we get into a lot more historical detail about Ecuador, what are the standard ways that this resource dependency we’ve been discussing in the context of the commodity boom is analyzed in social science? How does this complex case of Ecuador’s intra-left struggle over extraction prove it to be insufficient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The standard way that scholars analyze resource extraction—the political economy of resource extraction—is through the lens of the resource curse, and related concepts like the rentier state or the petrostate. The resource curse idea is that resource dependency, the fiscal, economic dependency on the export of resources like oil, gas, or mining, results in two types of pathologies, one economic and the other political. The economic pathology is that there tends to be underinvestment in more ‘productive’ sectors of the economy; all of the investment flows to the resources sectors because they tend always to have a global market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why invest in more long-term productive, industrial, or manufacturing capital? That’s the economic problem, and that leaves governments vulnerable to those boom-and-bust cycles.Then the political piece is that, ostensibly, states that depend upon resource extraction and exports are more likely to be authoritarian, either outright authoritarian-autocratic or lower-quality democracies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, there are lots of problems with this, because there are lots of governments in the world that have large resource sectors, but don’t seemingly fall prey to the resource curse. We are reminded that countries occupy different positions in the world system, and that that really shapes how extraction and export of resources will affect their political economy. It’s very different to be Norway than to be Ecuador, and those in turn relate to different internal trajectories of state-building and class relations. One problem is that there are too many exceptions to this rule for it to be a good guide to how resource politics will play out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way that I like to think about this particular problem—the fact that it doesn’t attend to the specific positions of countries in the global system—is Timothy Mitchell’s great line that all states are oil states. The resource curse states that the oil states are Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Ecuador—countries that have large oil sectors and export them. But Mitchell is saying that the entire global economy runs on oil, and hopefully not for much longer. To say that just the countries that happen to have oil in their countries are the ‘oil states’ is a real misunderstanding of the way that oil and capitalism relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s like the phrase ‘banana republic,’ which obscures which country is eating the bananas and which government is backing the banana-growers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. One issue is that it’s methodologically nationalist. It takes countries as these national containers, and doesn’t think about the relationships between them or their relationships to a global order. Now I’ll get a bit more into the case of Ecuador to get the texture of why the resource curse is not a very useful way to think about what happened in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, the resource curse predicts that countries dependent on these resources will become authoritarian, and that’s for various reasons. One is that resource rents are a great way to fund military and security apparatuses. Another is the idea of the political resource curse: if you don’t have to tax your citizens, they won’t demand representation. This very simplistic idea of what caused the American Revolution is then generalized into this rule of politics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poorly describes what happened in Ecuador. I’m not at all saying that Correa didn’t attempt in various ways to concentrate power; many leaders attempt to concentrate power. We need only to look at our own recent history, not just of Trump but of Bush, Obama, Clinton, and of increasing executive authority in the US. That’s not particularly tied to resources; that’s something that happens often in presidentialist systems, particularly. But more generally, what Ecuador saw amidst a commodity boom, amidst the circumstances that scholars would say most likely causes the resource curse to be set in motion, is a proliferation of conflict over democracy, of different ideas about democracy, of local, directly-affected communities and indigenous movements claiming forms of direct, communitarian democracy, and saying that they should have control over their territories, and enacting new democratic practices in order to resist extraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have the state paying a lot of lip service and policy reality to creating new participatory institutions for citizens to interact with the state. You have a constitution that dramatically expands collective rights, the rights that communities hold and that they can petition for. What you have is an efflorescence of practices and subjectivities on the terrain of democracy, and a fight over who is the, and how they enact their power. It’s not at all a situation which somehow resource dependency unilaterally determines, going down the road to authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Let’s set some key historical context. Ecuador first became a petrostate under a military government in 1972, and that government saw oil as key to developing the country. What sort of military government was Ecuador’s, and how did it fit into the third-world oil politics of that era? How was it that the military government “left an enduring ideological legacy of resource nationalism, which would later be reappropriated and radicalized by popular movements,” as you write? That’s normally not the legacy we think of with Latin American military governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This period of dictatorship runs from the sixties to the late eighties and early nineties, depending on the specific contexts, but there were two decades that saw a lot of military governments across the region. Many of them are right-wing, and many of them come into power specifically as a counter-reaction to the growth of popular labor and popular movement power under prior governments that were more leftist or progressive, or more nationalist. They’re specifically coming into power as reactionary forces. But not all military governments are the same, and at least in the cases I’m familiar with, which are Bolivia and Ecuador, there were military governments that came to power that were progressive in a sense, or at least had a nationalist developmentalist vision for the economy, and saw themselves as not primarily about repression—not to downplay the repression that those governments meted out, because they did—but more primarily about transitioning their countries up the ladder of economic development. This very much characterized the Rodríguez Lara government in Ecuador that came to power in 1972, and was in power until 1976. There was another military government right after that, and then in ‘79 you have democratization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rodríguez Lara government—this will be familiar to folks who are aware of the politics of oil in the 1970s—came to power, was bookended by these two major oil booms, these booms in oil prices that have their own reason and trajectory that I won’t get into right now. The Ecuadorian government prior to Lara knew that there were oil reserves. They had recently been discovered in the late 1960s, and the military government came to power with the explicit aim of creating a petrostate in Ecuador, of creating a state that could oversee, assert its authority over the oil sector and attract and export that oil with the specific goal of national development. That was the ideology and the policy paradigm of the Rodríguez Lara government. They established a state-owned oil company that still exists today. They asserted much more state control over the territories where oil was found, and how the state related to foreign corporations. They also instituted some progressive and some unclassifiable reforms. In the progressive category, they instituted Ecuador’s most major land reform, but they also instituted a policy called colonization, which was a policy to incentivize people from the highlands of Ecuador to move into the Amazon to help ‘develop’ the Amazon. That sets off lots of conflicts with indigenous communities. They also, as you mentioned, took a leading role in OPEC, in the early 1970s politics of OPEC. OPEC has become more dominated by Saudi Arabia since, but in the seventies, OPEC was a forum for the proliferation of left-ish or developmentalist resource-nationalist visions coming out of the Third World. It was the idea that the Third World had the right to manage or assert authority over its resources, and that it should aid the development of those countries, rather than the world-system or foreign capitalists. This was the rhetoric that the Rodríguez Lara government used. It was a piece of that broader moment that you discussed in your interview on the New International Economic Order, this moment of Third World solidarity and assertion of Third World political-economic power. OPEC, in a way, was one of the most successful artifacts of that moment because the New International Economic Order sought to create multiple such organizations related to different commodities that the Global South countries export. But oil was the one that got the most institutionalized.&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 What happened to Ecuador’s oil politics under democratic and neoliberal governments that followed the military government? What role did neoliberalized resource politics play in provoking the rise of anti-neoliberal social movements like the CONAIE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You mentioned the resource nationalist ideology of the Rodríguez Lara government—this idea that the state should control its resources and use it for the benefit of the people. In addition to bequeathing an institutional legacy of a state-owned oil company, which outlives the military government, I’d also bequeath an ideological legacy of resource nationalism. It’s important to note at this juncture, because it can get a little subtle, that the version of resource nationalism that the Rodríguez Lara government, as well as governments in Venezuela and throughout Latin America, tended to have was not anti-capitalist. It was anti-imperialist, though. It was against the power of the core states, the industrialized states, the former colonial powers. It was not anticapitalist per se. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s an important distinction, because what happens under the period of neoliberal hegemony that occurs after democratization in 1979, starting in the early eighties and up until Correa comes to power in 2007, is that Ecuador is ruled under a series of democratically-elected governments, several of which are deposed from power by the indigenous movement and its allies, but that all shared a basically neoliberal orientation to the economy. In that neoliberal period, there were attempts at oil deregulation, privatization, building privately-owned pipelines—I use the word ‘intentionally’ because not all of these worked out; they were policy goals, but from the outset, they were deeply contested. They were contested under the banner of radical resource nationalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this came from the oil workers’ union; it came from the indigenous movement, at both the national and regional scale, and other popular movements that they were in alliance with. What they did was inherit this legacy of resource nationalism, its symbolic repertoire, the equation of the nation with its resources, the idea that those resources should serve the people, a popular sense of who the people are. They inherit that from the dictatorship and radicalize it specifically in conflict and in contradistinction with the neoliberal form of resource governance that, to varying degrees, rules over Ecuador and its oil sector for those decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They radicalize it in the direction of anticapitalism. They make the connection between the imperial world order and the capitalist mode of accumulation. What they call for is the expropriation of oil resources from private, foreign hands into the public for state-owned resource companies that will be dedicated to using resource rents to lift up the economic fortunes of the masses. They even get more radical than that. So far, I’ve put this in anticapitalist terms; they also think about it in democratic terms. It’s not only about having state ownership, but about democratizing—thinking about what a democratically managed oil company would look like, one that served the interests of the 99%, the people writ large. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of this radical resource nationalism is partly an inheritance from the past, but it’s also partly an innovation in resistance to a conjuncture of ruling-class elite forces that had aligned themselves behind neoliberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The history of Ecuador’s indigenous movement is also key here in terms of understanding how the indigenous movement makes this turn, under Correa, from radical resource nationalism to anti-extractivism. You have highland or Andean indigenous organizing beginning all the way back in the 1930s, when rural peasant organizations allied with urban leftists to fight what was then the dominantsystem, which then ends in 1964 under the military government, which then lays the groundwork for the 1972 foundation of the highland indigenous federation Ecuarunari, which remains the largest indigenous federation in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But meanwhile, in the Amazon, there’s a distinct but parallel process of indigenous organization that emerges, in your words, “in response to the dual threats of colonization and oil exploration among the Sarayaku, Shuar, and Achuar peoples.” And that led to the creation of the first Amazon indigenous organization, the Organization of Indigenous Peoples of Pastaza, or OPIP, in 1978. And then, in 1980, the Amazon-wide federation CONFENIAE. How did these parallel but distinct processes of organization compare to each other, and how did their merger, creating CONAIE in 1986, create such a powerful and unified force? How did it weave together both this radical resource nationalism and, from the Amazon, this nascent anti-extractivism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s a really interesting history of the parallel formation of two distinctly territorialized indigenous movements that come together, join forces to become, as discussed, the most powerful social movement in Ecuador and, at certain moments, in the hemisphere. In terms of the particularities of how the national indigenous movement came to formation in Ecuador, part of what made it so powerful was the way that class-based demands, relating to ownership, property, class relations and the means of production, and demands that center on ethnicity, language, and cultural self-determination, were at various moments interwoven. One maybe prevailed over the other, but the fact that we had both of these demands deeply embedded in the indigenous movement is an artifact of this parallel trajectory of the Amazonian and Andean movements, and an important part of its broader political power and eventual ability to articulate a broad popular bloc that went beyond self-identified indigenous communities to include neighborhood associations and labor unions, all sorts of popular movements that did not identify as indigenous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Andes, in the mountainous region containing Quito—the region of the country that had been first and most deeply incorporated into the Spanish empire—you have a long history, as a result of the politics of colonialism, conquest, and independence, of tense, conflictual relationships between the indigenous masses and the American-born, Spanish-descended Creole elites. These conflicts had a political dimension to them because the masses were excluded, but they had a very important economic dimension, which was conflict over land access. Land tenure was extremely unequal, and there were conflicts over deep labor exploitation, a semi-feudalized system that tied people to the land through debt peonage and other means. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conflicts had a clear class dimension to them, and peasant unions formed. Those peasant unions had relationships with ideologically left formations, socialist and communist. I recommend the work of the historian Marc Becker on this, providing a deep dive into the relationship between indigenous and ideologically left politics in Ecuador. There were various state reformist attempts to dismantle the system of extremely unequal, semi-feudal land ownership, and those attempts were not to create an egalitarian society, but instead to assert some kind of state presence and reduce the power of these landowners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mix of this were the peasant unions, communities starting to self-organize, and those starting to self-govern at the local level. Out of that trajectory comes Ecuaranari, the highland indigenous federation with its deep roots in peasant organizing and in class-based formation. The whole time, weaving through the class demands is attention to forms of ethnic discrimination as well. Class was the primary category. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Amazon, there was a very different trajectory, where the indigenous movement arose not out of conflicts in the agricultural sector out of land and labor, but more as a response to this dual threat. On the one hand, as I mentioned previously, state-led colonization of the Amazon, which was the state’s attempt—first in the sixties, then in the seventies under the Rodríguez Lara dictatorship—to populate the Amazon more densely with highland people, some of whom wereand some of whom were highland indigenous people, to incentivize them to move with cheap land, credit, and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The process was called colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And the people who settled there were called colonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes. These were not upper-class people at all. The majority of them were working-class or lower middle-class, but they were seeking economic opportunity in the Amazon with state support. As they arrive in the Amazon, they encounter indigenous communities, nations, peoples that had been relatively autonomous. Their communities lived in large swaths of territory for hunting, fishing, ceremonial purposes, agriculture, and living. They had these territorialized, well-developed cultural systems that were now coming into direct conflict with a colonizing force. It wasn’t the Spanish colonizing them, but it felt similar, and it was, as you said, called colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time—again, this is under the military government with the expansion of oil extraction—a lot of extractive activity was starting. This includes oil extraction as well as logging and agriculture. It’s always important to keep in mind that with mega-agriculture and extractive activity, there are infrastructural requirements: road-building, new forms of transportation and communications, and more socio-technical infrastructure to support this, which also threatens the territorial ambit of indigenous peoples and nations. The radicalization of indigenous peoples in the Amazon is first and foremost about the territorial and cultural threat posed by extraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which extraction undermines the territorial and cultural integrity of an indigenous people becomes very important in later militant anti-extractivism. These themes are articulated in the moment that began in the 1970s; out of that came the Amazonian indigenous federation. The leaders of the highland and Amazonian federations then came together to form the national federation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this national federation so powerful? Especially with the combination of Amazonian and Andean groups, it wove together class and ethnic demands, cultural and economic grievances, in a way that showed a holistic understanding of what the nature of indigenous oppression was. It had multiple facets; it was intersectional. Articulating that explicitly is a form of political power. That lent it some strength. Another source of strength is the way that the federation was literally built through the ground up, from peasant unions, from local forms of indigenous self-government, from the territories of the Amazon and the cultural systems therein. It was built from the base, and it built up to a provincial level; it then built to a regional level, and ultimately to a national level. Nothing makes a movement or a political party stronger than deep territorialization, having layers of multiple scales in internal governance, decision-making, and mobilizing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobilizing capacity became immediately clear. In just a few years after the national indigenous federation formed in 1986, there was the first nationwide indigenous uprising in 1990. In 1992, there was the next nationwide indigenous uprising; in ‘97 and ‘98, there were several more. One after the other, you see national uprisings that were able to mobilize across the country, both in situ and bringing people into the capital, in ways that European-descended elites had never seen before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Though the indigenous movement is putting forward what you call this “key conceptual innovation,” the idea of a plurinational polity, it’s also, in the 1990s, at the lead of a “broad bloc of the oppressed.” You write, “At this juncture, CONAIE’s political project was at once indigenista and popular-democratic. The federation claimed to speak on behalf of a broad bloc of the oppressed, conceived of in both democratic (the people) and class (the poor) terms, and defined against a class of political-economic elites, the oligarchy. The identity articulation was not purely aspirational. It reflected on-the-ground alliances between indigenous and non-indigenous groups.” You’ve already touched on this a bit, but what was it about the politics of the neoliberal nineties that allowed the CONAIE to emerge as such a force, not only on behalf of indigenous people but also on behalf of the oppressed majority of Ecuador?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 From the very beginning, that first indigenous uprising in 1990 put key demands on the table that were both ethnic and class-based in character. That is important because the class versions of those demands had a possibility of articulating with other groups, groups that also experienced the same forms of class oppression, though not the ethnic forms of discrimination and marginalization, as indigenous nations and peoples did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from the very beginning, before it even had organizational links with other popular-sector groups, the CONAIE was putting forth demands that other groups could see themselves in. As the CONAIE gained strength and political protagonism, bringing people into the capital and rocking political elites, the neoliberal hegemony was beginning to consolidate. Elites became more committed to neoliberalism; this story was both domestic and global. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neoliberalism is a global phenomenon, but there were particular reasons that it was useful to Latin American domestic elites, who saw it as a way to undermine and dismantle the forms of popular power that had been achieved earlier in the century. This articulation of neoliberalism, of free-market deregulation was in alliance with international financial institutions like the IMF, which became strongly articulated in Ecuador by 1994. In that moment, the CONAIE began to formalize its alliances with a broader array of popular-sector groups that had their own alliance formation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CONAIE entered into a direct relationship with these other movements, and they became unstoppable. They deposed multiple presidents; they limited the ability of multiple neoliberal governments to implement their full program of neoliberalism. For example, some governments wanted to privatize the state-owned oil company, and they were unable to. It’s not that neoliberalism wasn’t achieved, but it wasn’t achieved to the degree that elites had hoped, and that was because of this broad public-sector alliance, mobilized under the banner of a broad popular identity, a heterogeneous bloc of the oppressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alliance represented the idea that the oppressed have multiple forms of oppression, but that what they share in common is being excluded from the political system and from the economic system. They have in common their exploitation and their marginalization, although it may take different forms, depending on their social location. They can ally around that, and what is interesting and unique about Ecuador is the way that the indigenous movement identified multiple oppressions and articulated its own internal intersectionality. That was key to its ability to connect to a broad array of other popular movements. The point of intersectionality is not to isolate in discrete corners of identities, but rather to identify the conditions and possibilities of solidarity. That is what the CONAIE did so successfully over so many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And the Ecuador experience is distinct from Bolivia’s, because in Bolivia, you see mass indigenous movements emerging often in the form of militant labor movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. In Bolivia, the history of the indigenous movement is a little more closely tied to that of various types of labor unions. Further back in history, you have a very militant mine workers’ union. We know from US history how militant mining unions tend to be. They were Trotskyist, very in the thick of anti-imperialist and anticapitalist politics of the day. Later, these miners, who had been laid off when the state-owned mine company was privatized in 1985, went to the coca-growing region of Bolivia, and they replicated their militant, hierarchical, politically and economically effective union formation in the coca-growing sector. That is the precise sector and union formation that Morales emerged from. Bolivia has a fascinating history of miners carrying their collective memory of discipline, coordination, and anticapitalist unionism with them to other parts of the country and sectors of the economy once they were massively laid off by the formerly state-owned mining company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 During this period prior to Correa, you write that there was “a nascent rejection of oil-led development that coexisted alongside calls to nationalize oil resources. The hegemony of neoliberal policies allowed for this provisional alignment of social movement organizations with such distinct political trajectories and positions on extraction.” What role did resource politics play in this period of social movement organization led by the CONAIE prior to Correa’s rise, and how was it that neoliberal hegemony allowed anti-extractivism and radical resource nationalism, which would later come into such conflict under Correa, to coexist productively?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’ve emphasized the role of the CONAIE’s discourse, tactics, and organizational forms, but I also could have emphasized the role of neoliberalism in constituting a unified target of various grievances. Elites rallied together under the banner of free-market reforms, which was ironically helpful in unifying popular forces because there were so many different things wrong with neoliberalism. Obviously, it created poverty and unemployment; it destroyed labor unions; it led to environmental devastation due to the forms of deregulation; it allowed foreign capital to control large swaths of the economy. Many different social positions could find a problem with neoliberalism, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neoliberalism was part of what allowed for the provisional unity of distinct critiques of capitalism, distinct critiques of neoliberalism, and distinct critiques of extraction. One of the critiques of extraction is a resource nationalist critique that got radicalized, especially by the role of the oil workers’ union, which was quite militant. They put their bodies on the line to protest against the privatization of various aspects of the oil sector, to protest against the building of a privately-owned pipeline. One oil worker described it to me in an interview like this: Imagine a corporation owns the veins in your body. That is how they view the foreign control of the oil sector. These are dramatic terms, and it’s a dramatic rejection of capital’s control of the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radical resource nationalism was in its full form during the late nineties and early 2000s. But there was this other critique of extraction beginning to percolate. It wasn’t quite nationally resonant yet, but it was very rooted in the experience of Amazonian indigenous communities, peoples, and nations, like the Achuar and the Quechua, whom you mentioned earlier. They are getting into increasing and militant confrontation with oil companies and with the state, both state bureaucrats and state-owned oil companies. They are in conflict with everyone trying to extract oil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict sets off because in this neoliberal moment with various forces pushing in favor of expanding extraction—the IMF, the World Bank, governments and corporations—oil extraction moves from its traditional location in the northern Amazon to the southern Amazon. When extraction reaches a new sector or affects new people and ecosystems, it becomes contentious in a different way. That is exactly what happened in the southern Amazon, starting in the 1990s and 2000s. Groups that hadn’t previously been in direct contact with oil extraction face the threat to their territory, cultural integrity, and pre-existing livelihoods. They use all the militant tactics in the book, including the detaining of oil executives and government officials that tried to expand oil extraction in the southern Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More militant anti-oil activism emerged in the Amazon. It wasn’t initiated as a critique of the entire extractive model of development. It was more articulated as the specific threat of oil to indigenous cultural and territorial integrity. The demand was not necessarily an end to all oil extraction, but instead that indigenous peoples had a voice and veto power over oil extraction. Interestingly, every so often, new demands emerged, like “Maybe we should have a moratorium on oil.” These were the seeds of a more oppositional stance to extraction, in contradistinction to radical resource nationalism, which is more about the people owning and democratizing resource sectors, and removing them from the hands of capital. This stance focused on the idea of no extraction at all, and importantly, it was articulated not just against foreign companies, like resource nationalism, but also against the state, because it saw the state’s role in opening up new frontiers to accumulation by oil-driven dispossession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The CONAIE played a key role in ousting President Bucaram in 1997 and Mahuad in 2000. But then they suffered a huge blow to their power, influence, and credibility after they backed Lucio Gutiérrez, who first as a colonel had backed the 2000 coup against Mahuad but, after he was elected president in 2003, embraced neoliberalism and became extremely unpopular. CONAIE was on the margins when this movement known as the forajidos ousted Gutiérrez. This was the movement that formed the basis of Correa’s campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You write, “Notably, neither CONAIE, which had hitherto been the main articulator of political discontent and coordinator of protest, nor existing leftist political organizations played a role in this particular rebellion.” Nonetheless, Correa went on to “re-deploy the very critique of neoliberalism voiced by CONAIE and their popular-sector allies over the past decade and a half.” What did it mean for the forajidos, rather than the CONAIE, to be the proximate push for Ecuador’s entry into the Pink Tide? What did that mean in turn for the sort of party Alianza País was founded to be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s a complex history, and a fast-moving one. Every couple of years, there’s a turning-point. In the late 1990s, there were a few years of deep economic crisis in Ecuador. There was a hyper-inflation crisis; there was widespread immiseration due in part to neoliberal reforms, but also to economic mismanagement. CONAIE decides to support a coup attempt against the government in power that presided over this hyperinflation crisis, and that also presided over the dollarization of Ecuador, which was intended to end the hyperinflation crisis. Ecuador uses the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucio Gutiérrez wanted to do a coup against the government; the CONAIE supported it. It was a short coup; Gutiérrez didn’t take power, but it did result in the vice-president stepping in when the president resigned. This was the beginning of what the indigenous activist whom I quote in the book, Mónica Chuji, calls the most contradictory moment of the indigenous movement in Ecuador, because they supported a coup that didn’t work in the sense that it didn’t bring a left-wing government to power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later, the leader of that coup, Gutiérrez, ran for president on a popular, populist political program that was not explicitly neoliberal. Immediately, he bait-and-switched, instituting neoliberal reforms. The CONAIE looked bad first for supporting a coup and second for supporting the election of Gutiérrez, who then betrayed them, not only by instituting neoliberalism but for intentionally and successfully co-opting certain indigenous leaders, offering them positions in government—a government that would then come under criticism of the indigenous movement. Shortly thereafter, Gutiérrez was forced to resign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, the government was forced to resign not primarily because of the CONAIE, which had lost some of its political capacity for some of the reasons just described, but by a somewhat inchoate set of street protests that lots of different people participated in, from more obvious left-wing forces to the mayor of Quito. Everyone was out on the streets because Gutiérrez was so terrible, and because he had betrayed his campaign promises so clearly. Out of that moment of working- and middle-class, left and establishment rejection of Gutiérrez and of neoliberalism, the possibility of Correa running for office emerged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That lack of a clear ideological articulation, as well as a lack of a clear social base, was visible in what became Correa’s political party, Alianza País, which was less a political party than an electoral vehicle. For various reasons in Ecuadorian electoral law, it’s actually easy to form these parties that are not really parties, known more as political movements, that can appear on the ballot but do not necessarily have deeply institutionalized organizational forms. Alianza País was created so that Correa, a former finance minister who had a reputation for being heterodox and progressive, and for railing against the debt, US imperialism, and the lack of social spending, could come to power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the indigenous movement doing at this moment? The indigenous movement was not very active in the leadership of the street rebellions that led to Correa’s rise to power. But they were not totally inactive at this moment. A few months after the forajidos’ rebellion, they helped organize massive protests in the capital against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which was the attempt to expand NAFTA to the entire hemisphere. The attempt failed. People came out in forceful protest against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, but they also couched that in anti-colonial language, given that it was a protest against the commemoration of Spanish conquest in October of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CONAIE wasn’t really involved in the protests that led to Correa coming to power, but it was still active, and it was attempting to re-articulate and find its political voice after the period of its legitimacy crisis, caused by its support of the coup. Correa came to power with a broad backing of many parts of the population, with a promise to fundamentally shift Ecuador’s economic and political direction away from neoliberalism, and with the critical support of the CONAIE. He did not run through the indigenous political party; he didn’t come from the CONAIE; he is not indigenous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the CONAIE didn’t reject him. They had a critical stance toward Correa, and I discovered through my archival work that the CONAIE and Correa were planning on running on a ticket together. It fell apart, partly because of Correa’s personality; he doesn’t really work well with others, and he has a strong personality. He refused specifically to allow for primaries for candidate selection because he didn’t want the possibility of his being the vice-president if he got the second most votes. He wanted to be at the top of the ticket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a moment in which the indigenous movement and Correa were going to run together on the ticket, and that fell apart for somewhat idiosyncratic reasons. History is always contingent to some degree. The CONAIE supported Correa; I would guess the vast majority of their members voted for him. But when he came to power, the CONAIE made their demands clear: “Remember, you promised to dismantle and transcend neoliberalism; you also promised a constituent assembly to rewrite the Constitution.” This had been a longstanding demand of the CONAIE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CONAIE had played a major role in politicizing the Constitution, meaning that they brought to popular attention the fact that constitutions are documents that support certain political and economic orders. The Constitution had been rewritten a decade prior, in ‘97 and ‘98, which was connected to that trajectory of indigenous uprisings; they had put the demand on the table for a new constitution. By no means did they get everything they wanted in it, but they left their imprint on it, and they decided that this was not enough; they needed a post-neoliberal constitution, one that would take Ecuador into a new political-economic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correa responded to that demand, which had at that point, because of the CONAIE’s organizing work, become a widespread popular demand. He set up elections to install a constituent assembly, popular and democratically elected, and they got to work in 2007 in rewriting the Constitution and coming up with what constitutional scholars agree is one of the most, if not the most, progressive constitutions in the world, in terms of the way that it makes clear that popular sovereignty and democracy is the foundation of the state. It sets out a whole array of new collective economic, political, and cultural rights, applied to collectivities and not just individuals, in a departure from liberal constitutionalism. It also departs from all constitutionalisms because it gives legal standing to nature, empowering human individuals and communities to go to court for nature when its rights are violated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Before we get deeper into Ecuador’s constituent assembly, what role did constituent assemblies play in the Pink Tide in general? Three countries have them: Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela. As we continue to see in Chile today, why is Latin America exercising this form of constituent power, deemed such a consistent priority for the left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I want to recommend the work of another scholar: Angélica Bernal has written beautifully on constituent politics in Latin America, and specifically on the Pink Tide moment of those constituent politics. Part of answering your question is getting outside the blinders of American exceptionalism, which affects our viewpoints, even on the left. In the US it seems so unusual and dramatic to rewrite the Constitution, given that we have been living under this document for hundreds of years. Even on the left, there are rarely calls—not recently, at least—to rewrite the Constitution, even as people are calling for the abolition of the Electoral College and the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Constitution has this sacredness, and in many other countries in the world, it’s not that way. There have been more dramatic changes in regime type, which opens up the possibility to rewrite constitutions. Movements of various sorts have seen constitutions as living documents, and as documents that need to be scrapped and rewritten. Latin America is part of what is more common in the rest of the world. Because of the influence of the indigenous movement and the way that it articulated the foundations of oppression and exploitation for so many years, the movement was drawn to the idea of rewriting the Constitution as a way to re-found Ecuador in a way that would fundamentally break from its colonial Creole forms of elite power that had shaped it, but also break from neoliberalism, because they understood that it had a legal basis encoded into the regulatory state. That must be undone to create a social state, a democratic state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in Bolivia and Venezuela, they also saw the Constituent Assembly as an important venue to articulate a variety of popular demands. The occurrence and unfolding of the Constituent Assembly provided a forum to debate deep questions that movements had been bringing to public attention for many years. Something about the institutional setting of the assembly was appealing. We can debate how much the Constitution totally transformed Ecuador, but it did absolutely provide a new set of rights and political orientations that had a new legitimacy to them because they were encoded in the Constitution. It gave movements a new set of languages and symbols, as well as a new discursive repertoire, that had legitimacy because it was in the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More so than totally re-founding the state of Ecuador, which it did in certain ways, the Constitution gave legitimacy to a lot of movement claims, and it allowed them to portray themselves, particularly the indigenous movement, as the defenders of the Constitution. This is interesting when you think of the dynamics of conflict between the state and movements—that movements put themselves in the position of being the defenders of a popular constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Ecuador’s Constituent Assembly “provided a venue for the articulation of two political projects: a nascent anti-extractivism and radical resource nationalism.” The final text of the 2008 Constitution retains vestiges of both. It empowers communities affected by extraction, and it grants rights to nature. It also asserts the state’s exclusive control over sub-soil resources and biodiversity itself. When the assembly was convened, resource extraction did not yet divide the left, but soon after it convened, it did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this divide begin to emerge in the assemblies’ debates, and how did those debates shape the divides and conflicts that would follow, particularly over what it meant to exercise democratic control over Correa’s proposed creation of a large-scale mining sector?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In contrast to some of the ways that other scholars studied these constituent moments — these moments of re-authorization, creating a new basis of political legitimacy — I think of these moments, particularly in the case of Ecuador, as opening rather than closing political questions. They create a new terrain, a new set of terms available, new sources of legitimacy that different actors can claim. It opens a new cycle of contention, rather than closing and settling a cycle of contention. This is very much the case in the Constituent Assembly in Ecuador, where these big questions were raised, and in large part because of the intellectual influence of the national indigenous movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions like “What is the relationship between the state and the nation?” might be answered by thinking of a single national people and a single political apparatus. The CONAIE disagreed with that. They said, “We live in a plurinational state. There’s one state, sure, but there are many different nations that it represents and interacts with.” Plurinationalism was a term that the CONAIE imported into the constituent assembly. Another concept, ‘sumak kawsay’ in Quechua (‘buen vivir’ in Spanish or ‘living well’ in English) is in opposition to and a critique of traditional forms of development and developmentalism—that the goal should not be economic growth or endless accumulation or consumerism. The goal should be living well, some kind of harmony within human communities and between nature and human communities. That was another big set of debates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These terms made it into the final document, but they made it in through a set of political conflicts that in some cases divided members of Alianza País, Correa’s party, against one another. One of the interesting points of conflict that I dwell on a lot in the book, which split members of Alianza País, was the question of how much power local communities should have over resource extraction. Extraction became a divisive intra-left issue. Some members of Alianza País, and members of the indigenous party Pachakutik, as well as some other left parties, wanted a strong form of local, territorial autonomy in which directly affected communities would not just have to be consulted if an extractive firm wanted to extract resources in their territory; they would have to give consent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the majority of Alianza País supported what the president supported, and he intervened in this question. They believed that people should be consulted, but that the state should ultimately have the authority; that is how the clause is written. These fissures open up over the relationship between state and nation, humans and nature, locals and national. They increasingly hinge on the question of what movements begin to call extractivism, which is what they begin to name the political-economic system that they live under. They stop talking about neoliberalism and begin to talk about extractivism. For them, neoliberalism lost some of its critical traction when the Correa government self-identified not only as post-neoliberal, but as socialist. They felt that if a post-neoliberal government was going to push for extraction, which it did after the constituent assembly, then there had to be a deeper problem that could also infect left-wing governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That problem was extractivism. Several months after the Constituent Assembly closed and the Constitution was ratified, Correa pushed through a bill that became the new national mining law, setting the framework for the inauguration of large-scale mining in Ecuador. Just months after all of these rights had been won for nature, buen vivir, plurinationalism, and other things at the constituent assembly, the indigenous movement turns around and has to confront the threat of the massive expansion of extractive activity, and of a specific extractive sector that is extremely land-intensive, that would result in the dispossession of entire communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 They did so by embracing the Constitution as their own, even after the CONAIE only critically supported the referendum approving the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes, and I think this is a good moment to pause and return to the dilemmas, tensions, and tradeoffs of the left coming to power, and how movements responded. The CONAIE threaded this needle in various ways over time. Their initial response to having a left-wing government in power, one that did not come from indigenous movements or from any social movements, was critical support. That was how they responded to the election of Correa, and it was how they responded to the ratification of the Constitution. The Constitution didn’t contain all of their demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the Constitution is ratified, they dropped the critical part, because they realized very intelligently that the Constitution was an extremely powerful tool to defend their rights and territories against the encroachment of extractivism. So they put aside the fact that they didn’t get everything they wanted—for example, the placement of the indigenous language, Quechua, at the same level of Spanish as a national language; it’s designated slightly differently in the Constitution—and they didn’t win prior consent. They didn’t win everything they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But they acted as though they had won prior consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 They acted like they won because they took the Constitution on as their own. They realized and knew how much the Constitution itself was the outcome of trajectories of popular struggle, and they were not going to let the government own the Constitution, even though it wasn’t entirely made in the image of the indigenous movement. They claimed it as a tool of legitimacy; they claimed it as a set of symbolic and discursive resources, of a new legal language. They took it to the streets and to the territories, using it tactically to defend territories against extraction. In doing so, they gave life to the Constitution. It was not a dead document; it was living, and it was not just any type of living document. It lived through the contentious activity of grassroots movements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Correa, of course, did not attempt to engineer a green exit from the world system, a system that confines countries like Ecuador to primary commodity goods and exports. Instead, he tried to take advantage of the commodity boom by expanding large-scale mining. But did Correa’s environmentalist opponents and indigenous opponents have an idea for how such an exit—an Ecuador without extraction—might happen? In your opinion, is such an exit even possible at all? Can you have green socialism in one country within an oil-fueled, capitalist world system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The answer to that last question is no, and I don’t mean that in a nihilistic, pessimistic sense, as though it’s not worth it to fight for such things. Rather, in order for Ecuador to transition out of so-called extractivism, changes at the regional and global scale would need to occur, and I think it’s important for the US left to think about this. Unfortunately, over the past few decades, the US left has lost its internationalism and its orientation to the international, and lost the idea that a lot of what we are struggling for is something we struggle for both domestically and internationally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that the limitations of the Pink Tide were not just of their own making, not just of their own personal idiosyncrasies, but also came from the parameters and constraints that they found themselves in. First and foremost, they found themselves in national economies that had been thoroughly integrated into global economies, in which foreign capital was thoroughly implicated, and in which large swaths of territory had already been slated for extraction and for environmental ruin. There are always different choices that could be made; there were parts of the Correa government, some of the bureaucrats, that were deeply committed to a post-extractive transition, and that laid out extensive, detailed plans for what a post-extractive economy might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the question of fiscal resources, especially under conditions of debt—Correa did default on some of Ecuador’s debt, but Ecuador remains an indebted country, debt that I consider illegitimate and unsustainable—there were limitations to what the government could do. When I talked to these bureaucrats who were interested in turning Ecuador into a post-extractive economy, oftentimes they would justify the expansion of extraction in the present. They would say, “Yes, we know mining is terrible, and we think it should be slowed down or limited, or rights should be more respected. But mining is our last chance. We have this commodity boom; the money is flowing in. China is interested in our resources. We need to take advantage of this so that we can store up the resources to invest in the knowledge sector”—things like ecosystem and biological research. Ecuador is an incredibly biodiverse place, and so that was appealing to them. Things in the service sector, like ecotourism related to Ecuador’s biodiversity, were also interesting to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had visions for an eco-economy, but they felt like it was important to take advantage of the commodity boom in order to store up the resources. The problem is that once you commit to expanding the extractive frontier, you get hooked into it. It’s challenging, because of the nature of the boom-and-bust cycles. You can’t control when the boom is going to end, and all of a sudden, you find yourselves without financial resources, as happened under Correa; austerity was imposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Latin Americans, leftists and otherwise, have long embraced something called ‘dependency theory”’ to explain their country’s place in the world-system. That was the intellectual analog to an economic development model called ‘import substitution industrialization,’ which, before the neoliberal turn, sought to move Third World countries up the value chain to break them out of this subordinate position within the world system. How was ISI displaced by neoliberalism decades ago, and why was it that the Pink Tide failed to revive that model, or something like it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You write, “Fundamentally, if in the mid-century variant of developmentalism, the goal was rapid industrialization, which would progressively reduce the share of the economy occupied by extraction while climbing the ladder of economic sophistication, the neo-developmentalism of the Pink Tide made peace with service-sector dominated labor markets and prioritized extraction over manufacturing, coordinating to protect prices, enforce standards for revenue sharing, or jointly adopt labor and environmental regulations, have competed for investment. They thus betrayed promises of regional integration and mutually reinforced their peripheral status.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The question as to why the Pink Tide didn’t revive ISI or revive more developmentalist orientations that would have sought to industrialize is one that I’ve already answered in terms of neoliberalism having already undermined the state’s capacity to do so. It had already so invited the foreign capital domination of those economies, and had already so integrated those economies into global markets. And there was a commodity boom, so the temptation to use those resource rents rather than to do long-term capital investments to create an industrial base conspired against the resuscitation of developmentalism in its classical sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why that classical form of developmentalism took hold and came up against internal contradictions, as well as the extreme reactions of a global and domestic ruling class, have been covered in many books. I think Christy Thornton’s new book speaks to a lot of this moment of left-wing developmentalism coming out of the Global South, specifically in the case of Mexico. One of the global contexts that had initially helped ISI flourish in Latin America was a temporary cutting-off of Latin American countries from the world system, and temporary depressions in global trade. For example, there was the Great Depression, as well as the interwar and war periods. In these moments were the beginnings of this endogenous form of development in which Latin American elites, to varying degrees of success, tried to industrialize, positively using the opportunity to reduce trade with the Global North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the contrast with the neoliberal period is evident, where there was no protection from the onslaught of global capitalism or of the presence of global markets or foreign capital. With ISI, there’s a lot to say about why it ultimately foundered and why it was replaced by neoliberalism. Some of this is a political story, which is that the domestic ruling classes, in concert with the US and with foreign capital, eventually came to see ISI as a threat in certain contexts, because it resulted in a more organized working class with the development of manufacturing and of workers’ unions, as well as more popular economic and political power. That began to threaten ruling classes, and part of the story of those right-wing dictatorships was the story of a reaction to both developmentalism and attempts at social-democratic reforms, as well as outright socialism in the case of Allende. This is clearest in Chile and Argentina, which had right-wing dictators that broke with ISI tradition and switched to neoliberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, in Brazil, there was also a dictatorship that came to power in 1964, but that dictatorship continued with ISI for a while; it came out of the upper echelons of the political and economic military technocracy that had implemented ISI. What happened in Brazil is that ISI entered into some of its own internal contradictions. It was about moving up the ladder of economic value and development, so that you eventually produce value-added, manufactured goods and capital-intensive, sophisticated goods like cars and steel. But you start with the lower-tech consumer goods, like processed foods or textiles. You move up the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the issue with ISI is twofold. First, throughout ISI, you still need to import things, but what you need to import becomes increasingly expensive, because you need to import the technology and the capital goods in order to produce these more sophisticated products; you get yourself more and more into debt. It’s a chicken-and-egg problem that is created by the conditions of global capitalism and the legacies of colonialism. You have that issue, and then you also have an internal dependency of the industrial sector on the agricultural and other export sectors. Those export sectors are important because they bring in the foreign currency that is then spent on capital imports. But if anything happens to those global markets, like we’ve been discussing, you suddenly don’t have the needed foreign reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also difficult political relationships, because the agro-exporting elites tend to be more conservative; they’re not in love with being in alliance with the industrialists, because that puts them in indirect alliance with workers’ unions. There are all sorts of political dilemmas to the ISI coalition. There are external, internal, economic, and political reasons that ISI comes to a close, and the stage for neoliberal hegemony is then set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 How do these more recent conflicts over whether to extract fit into a longer history that is so often for the neoliberal turn, including for the heyday of ISI, that made energy and extraction workers such a powerful and militant vanguard of organized labor? What does this reveal about the role played by energy or by extraction more generally in capitalism, or in any mode of production, and what accounts for oil workers and miners in the past finding themselves at the vanguard of such movements, while more recently, in your book, anti-extraction movements have found themselves boxed in and relatively marginalized, while extraction workers are relatively powerless?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This is a really interesting question on the relationship between extraction and capitalism on the one hand, and on the other hand, extraction and militant forms of critique and resistance, both labor and indigenous. There is a long history in Marxism, throughout the twentieth century, of thinking about imperialism as a specific form of expansion of capital to territories not previously under its ambit, or not fully integrated into capitalism, and of the kinds of violence and political power that are implicated with economics at those frontiers or vanguard settings of the expansion of capital. Luxemburg’s writing on this is great, but so is Harvey’s analysis of accumulation of dispossession—that at these frontiers of capital’s expansion, we get some of the most violent forms of capital, often with state assistance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that token, we also get the possibility of forms of resistance and critique that identify the connection between the political and the economic, the connection between state violence and economic profitability. In all sorts of contexts in the world, we can see radical forms of politics in extractive economies. Sometimes these take the form of labor politics. Timothy Mitchell’s book Carbon Democracy is great here; it’s less about accumulation by dispossession in a physical frontier of capitalism, and more about how extraction and energy—coal, in this case—is such a central node of the industrializing capitalist economy in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Labor has a particular power because it’s working at the chokepoint of the whole system. That’s another way in which extraction can be politicized and serve as the venue for radical forms of grassroots power because of its importance to the system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ecuador, unlike what Mitchell describes about oil in his book, oil was auspicious for worker power, but too much so, because elites really reacted to that. Oil workers literally put their bodies on the line, protesting against privatization and pipelines, articulating this radical resource nationalism that resonated along the broader population. They faced severe repression and criminalization, jailing, and accusations of terrorism. There was a way in which that elite reaction to radical resource nationalism undermined the political power of radical resource nationalism; it lost some of its most important leaders and articulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years, in the early 2000s, Correa comes to power. He prioritizes large-scale mining; that opens up whole new territories to extractive dispossession and environmental ruin, and that politicizes a different set of actors around mining; it creates a slightly different coalition. It doesn’t involve workers as much, because mining doesn’t exist yet. It’s a plan, so there aren’t any mine workers at this moment, early on in Correa’s government. The territory is being leased, but the mines haven’t been built yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local anti-mining groups also flourish, as well as coalitions between radical environmentalists, local anti-mining groups—sometimes indigenous, sometimes local farmers that are worried about the effects of mining on water and crops—and the indigenous movement, which had various longstanding critiques of extraction. Out of that new coalition that relates to the distinct territoriality and dynamics of a new extractive sector is a wholesale critique of extraction, a rejection of extraction. There is a shift from radical resource nationalism to anti-extractivism, drawing on those prior symbolic and tactical resources of the Amazonian indigenous groups that had began to protest oil more militantly in the 1990s, drawing on the new language of the Constitution that endows local communities, indigenous collectivities, and nature with new rights, and drawing on a transnational diffusion of radical environmentalism in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on these discursive, symbolic resources, there emerges a wholesale and powerful militant critique of extraction that resets the terrain. Movements are in the protagonist role here, because they forced the Correa administration to respond—sometimes with co-optation, sometimes with attempts to say that it would invest in local communities, so that they should support mining, and sometimes with renewed forms of criminalization. Almost two hundred indigenous leaders defending land and water faced legal charges and sometimes imprisonment under Correa. The state had to respond, and sometimes the power of movements was visible in the state’s repressive response. But the repressive response was not able to squash these movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you hint in your question, however, these movements were powerful with their militant, tactical, and clear critiques, resisting extraction at the sites of extraction, but also at the sites of decision-making in Quito, the capital. There were different territorial angles to their protest, as well as forging new alliances. There was a limitation on this movement, which was that it was deeply based in the experience and grievances of communities that would be directly affected by extractive projects. Those communities, whether indigenous or not, although they were mostly indigenous, were not the majority of society; they were in the rural peripheries of the state of Ecuador, in the southern highlands and in the southern Amazon. They were not located in the centers of urban political and economic power, where tactics of disruption can be quite successful, because you can grind the politics and economy to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had a difficulty in re-articulating that broad, popular, heterogeneous bloc of the oppressed that had been so successful in not just resisting neoliberalism, but also putting forth positive visions of what an alternate economy and society and polity might look like. The anti-extractive movement was often caught in a corner of forcefully and sometimes successfully resisting extractive projects in a negative sense, focusing on the harms and grievances. But when they moved to what the positive vision of post-extractive society would look like, it was more difficult; it’s hard to imagine a formerly colonized place still constrained by colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism transitioning out of that on its own. Can you have eco-socialism in one Global South country alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty was not of their own making, but it was a difficulty. It limited both how many people got involved in the anti-extractive movement, but also the movement’s power to present the type of ideology and program that could come to state power. What would an anti-extractive political party look like if it took the reins of state power, got popularly elected, and embarked on its program? There are difficulties on the state side and on the movement side that parallel one another. The left-wing bureaucrats that wanted to transition to post-extractivism faced the difficulty of transition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a transitional program look like? What does it look like to slowly dismantle the bad and to replace it with the good? This is something that leftists around the world have to think of, because you never arrive to power in circumstances of your own choosing. You arrive to power with constraints, with legacies, with forces that want to get you out of power. You have to figure out ways to get from Point A to Point B that involve gradation, transition, complex temporalities of policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 A core problem that we may have missed for anti-extractive social movements in Ecuador is that it was a relatively small number of people affected who lived near where the mining was going to happen, and a relatively large number of people in cities like Quito who were benefiting from increased social spending under Correa, which creates a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. Thank you for bringing that up. A way to conceive of this is what I call the uneven territoriality of extraction, and it’s uneven in its harms, meaning that certain communities are marginalized, affected, and contaminated by the harms of extraction, but it’s also uneven in its benefits. Sometimes that takes the form of corporations getting all the profits, or the state getting the resources and not distributing them. But in this case it took a more politically complex form, where masses of Ecuadorians, including working-class and indigenous Ecuadorians, benefited materially from the increased social spending and industrial investments that resource rents funded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also were ideologically invested in this resource nationalist idea, which movements had promoted for years, that the state should use the resources to the benefit of the people. There was a supreme irony in anti-extractive movements coming up against their own successes — the successes of their prior radical resource nationalism, the success of their demands that resource rents be redistributed to the people. But in the face of those successes, anti-extractive movements radicalized around a new pole of conflict, which was the question of extraction itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You cite a few examples of environmental struggles, with which this broader coalition that the CONAIE and social movements had been unable to recreate under Correa did somewhat emerge. One was in the southern highlands city of Cuenca, Ecuador’s third largest city, where a proposed mining project “would affect their shared water supply, which irrigates both dairy and vegetable farms, and slakes urban demand”—unifying campesinos and city dwellers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example was the YASunídos campaign, which gathered signatures for a referendum to block oil drilling in the Amazon’s Yasuní national park. This emerged after Correa’s proposal to the international community to not drill in the Yasuní in exchange for $3.6 million in international donations to compensate for the ecological debt owed to Ecuador. This failed, and the international community did not pay up. What did these campaigns accomplish, and what does that signal about how central politics linking environmental and economic demands, urban workers and rural peasants, might operate at a larger scale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Scale is exactly the question here. The uneven territoriality of extraction enables the political power of directly affected communities. Those communities located at the immediate sites of extraction have political power that rests at the same place as the power that workers have at a factory. It is their leverage to disrupt the circuits of extraction at their source, just like when workers go on strike and disrupt the production and accumulation of capital at its source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local communities had that kind of power in this territorially uneven extractive economy. The flip side of this is the limit. You need more than local communities to create a mass program for a post-extractive left political force. In an unintended way, there was a reproduction of that uneven territoriality in the tactics of anti-extractive movements. They hemmed themselves in, in certain ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the case of the mine near Cuenca—the movement was so successful that that mine is not happening—the planned mine near the third largest city of Ecuador and the campaign to have a massive citizen referendum on whether or not to extract oil in this extremely biodiverse rainforest have in common is that they go against the grain of that territoriality. They make the powerful claim that multiple scales and territories of the state are affected negatively by an extractive model of development. They can also show what an alternative looks like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these campaigns managed to do that, and in the case of Cuenca, there was a deep alliance made between the local and provincial indigenous federation, between water associations, which had the power of managing water irrigation for farmers in that area, and between urban environmentalists that, for varying but complementary reasons, all opposed a mine that might contaminate the water system that both farmers, consumers, and other economic sectors depended on. They had a strong enough coalition that they were able to stall and potentially stop that mining project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the different constituencies involved, the different types of arguments that they made, and the fact that it was not just in a locally-affected community, but went all the way to a large city. And in the case of the Yasuní, what’s amazing about it is how they brought a proposal, one that was originally Correa’s proposal but had failed because the international community refused to pay the money he asked for to prevent oil extraction, through a youth movement that emerged, recalling the promise to protect the ecosystem and the indigenous people that lived in it. They mobilized quickly, and they got enough signatures for a referendum. However, the state electoral agency disqualified enough of those signatures to stop that referendum from going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both cases had appeals to scales and territorially-defined constituencies that exceed the ‘directly affected community,’ or even expand the notion of who is directly affected by extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You also mention the 2019 mass revolt against Correa’s successor and erstwhile ally, Lenín Moreno, over austerity measures that he imposed as part of a deal with the IMF, which included, critically, ending a fuel subsidy. As you note, “Crucially, this provisional alliance was not anti-extractivist in orientation. It was, if anything, radical resource nationalist.” What does it mean that that frame continues to be such a better one for mass mobilization and creating left popular alliances at this scale that is necessary to win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Part of what it demonstrates is something I mentioned earlier, the way that neoliberalism can help provisionally unify different social forces and massify social protests in a way that is more challenging when the left is in power. Moreno was ostensibly a leftist; he was Correa’s vice president, but he came to power through a total bait-and-switch. He started implementing neoliberal reforms; he had a deal with the IMF, and one of the provisions of this deal with the IMF was that he eliminate the fuel subsidy, a very common thing in petrostates where diesel and gasoline are subsidized for ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sparked a major social crisis for Moreno. It was already in the context of a deepening economic crisis in Ecuador because of the fallout of the commodity bust. Amid the combination of his betrayal, the IMF, and the elimination of this popular program—though in a sense regressive, really important to working-class people living at the margins of their income—the CONAIE returns to its historic role as the articulator of mass popular protests of a variety of heterogeneous constituencies. It leads this several-day siege of the capital that results in Moreno completely backtracking, giving them the concession. The fact that an oil product is at stake here resonates with the history of resource nationalism, the idea that people should benefit from the oil economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to think about how this might be in contradiction with CONAIE’s avowed anti-extractivism, because at the same time, they fought Moreno on an anti-extractive front against mining and oil projects. They remained an anti-extractive organization, but in this case, they were fighting for the reinstatement of a hydrocarbon subsidy. What does that mean? One, it speaks to the enduring power of radical resource nationalism and its ideological power, its mobilizing capacity and its ability to stitch together a heterogeneous bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that they weren’t fighting for fuel, for more oil extraction. They were fighting for economic security and material well-being of the masses, and that is consistent; that is the type of transitional program that I discussed earlier. You can say consistently that for the time being, we are still extracting, and the benefits should go to the masses. But we should also be taking concrete political and economic steps, which would involve alliances with the rest of the Global South, calling for the cancellation of debt that crushes these countries and forces them into an extractive model of accumulation—that would involve all sorts of tactics at different scales and policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can coherently have a transitional program that moves toward a post-extractive model of development. I think that, in a way, the CONAIE rediscovered that possibility in the heat of popular protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You end your book, as you put it, on a “note of generosity to the left in power and the left in resistance.” We didn’t have time to talk about this, but the conflict between Correa and the CONAIE was particularly vitriolic because each side saw the other as betraying the left, as comrades who had betrayed their comrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You write, “Dilemmas are not feelings. They are the challenging choices in situations that any attempt to transform the world encounters. They are constituted by the entanglement of radical potentialities, concrete achievements, and disappointing limitations. These two forms of leftism confronted one another in a dispute that became so polarized that each saw the other as a political enemy more dangerous than neoliberalism. Lost in the internecine dispute was the radical promise of 21st-century socialism, collective democratic control over the conditions of socionatural existence. Such a program could have coherently demanded both the redistribution of oil and mining revenues and a transition away from the extractive model of accumulation that generates those revenues.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close out, what lessons can we learn from Ecuador about the politics of transitioning away from fossil fuels and extraction, given the setup of a very unequal world system and the fact that some form of minimal extraction, as you’re currently researching with regard to lithium, will always be necessary? Why do you think it’s important for us on the left to struggle over these sorts of questions as dilemmas, rather than presuming that our comrades on different sides of intra-left debates are enemies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There are a few different lessons. One is somewhat counterintuitive—the necessity of both the left in power and the left in resistance, the left in the streets. We can’t have a left program that just focuses on taking state power or that just focuses on a position of resistance. We actually need both, and we need them at the same time. Coming to power as the left should not signal the end of the street mobilization, or the popular power period of mobilization. We should think about this before we come to power, ideally—that’s not usually the case—to avoid the deep polarization and utter antagonism between these forms of leftism, which did occur in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I say that they’re both necessary, as the case of Ecuador demonstrates, is that the left in power achieved a dramatic advance and uplifting of the material conditions of the majority of Ecuadorians, not seen in Ecuador ever before. Of course, that foundered, or at least got much trickier to maintain with the end of the commodity boom, which shows the problems with the extractive model of development. But major achievements were made. Just the fact of having a government with so much democratic legitimacy that kept getting elected was a victory for the left in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left in resistance also had clear achievements, despite the limitations that we’ve discussed. It stopped some egregious extractive projects that were unnecessary to Ecuador’s well-being or economic development. It stopped some extractive politics. Importantly, it also bequeathed a radical critique and a repertoire of resistance that movements around the world have been inspired by, and that has diffused across Latin America. It’s hard to imagine Latin American indigenous and environmental politics today without some of the events that actually occurred in Ecuador. It’s a very unique case, in terms of how militant those struggles became. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make clear arguments on the generic level, that if the left is going to come to power in order to fulfill its promises, it needs to be held accountable by social movements. But more specifically, in a fraught case like Ecuador on the peripheries of the global economy, both movements and the state had some achievements, even if they were in tension with one another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma point that you raised at the end, and that I get at in the conclusion of the book, is really important. I like the way you put it, which is that viewing the tasks of taking power from the position of the left, from the grassroots, precisely via the social forces that have been denied that political and economic power, is an extremely fraught process. You are occupying the halls of a state that was in many ways designed to serve the interests of the ruling class. You are occupying that state in a context where investors, bosses, and capitalists control the key levers of economic decision-making, and you’re also coming to power in a social context thoroughly imbued with the subjectivity and affective orientations of neoliberalism and capitalism, in which people are alienated from one another, taught to compete, taught to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of political, ideological, economic, and affective constraints and difficulties along the road to left power. I think that the more we think about those at the outset, the more we can debate those and understand how to deal with them together, rather than breaking down and fragmenting on the left on the shoals of how we answer those questions, getting into intense disagreements with comrades because we have a different way to approach some of those dilemmas. Rather than that, we should think of those dilemmas as shared ground, as the immediate terrain we will have to walk through on this path to transformative and emancipatory power, and think tactically and strategically about how to deal with each one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the more that we can do that—I’m saying that as someone on the US left, as someone working a lot on Green New Deal politics, which is fraught with these questions, because the Green New Deal is a transitional program. The Green New Deal will get us from fossil capitalism to renewably powered social democracy. That is a path littered with dilemmas, contradictions, tradeoffs, and tensions, including ones that divide the class itself. The more that we can think in terms of shared dilemmas and multiple solutions to those dilemmas along the way, the more we can strengthen the left against its real enemies, which are not each other, but instead global capitalism, the ruling class, and imperialism.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan is playing catch up. Here’s a fav interview from the archives: critical theorist Nancy Fraser on how a total analysis of capitalism requires analyzing capitalism’s totality, including socially reproductive work that makes possible the world that capitalism exploits. This is painfully relevant today as people everywhere do the work of staying at home and social distancing to beat this pandemic while capitalists reap the rewards of the world’s reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The divide between Latin American and the United States was not always so evident. Across the hemisphere, creoles—the descendants of European settlers, born in the Americas—launched revolutions to cast off European rule and preserve their own elite position over black and indigenous people. Joshua Simon explains how rival settler-colonial projects became today’s status quo of US dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

There, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, continues in power under Prime Minister Narendra Modi after winning a huge victory in this year’s elections. The BJP, however, isn’t just a party. It’s the electoral wing of a Hindu nationalist movement that constitutes the largest and most organized far-right force on earth. A deep dive with Indian scholar Achin Vanaik.&lt;/p&gt;

While Boston whites fought school busing in the streets, suburban liberals along Route 128 maintained and benefited from the larger system of metropolitan residential and school segregation that made the crisis possible. Suburban liberals also played a key role in creating a new Democratic Party that embraced a superficial politics of recognition while advancing a technocratic elite-driven neoliberal agenda that included the demonization and persecution of poor black mothers on welfare and mass incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Denvir:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Dig, a podcast from Jacobin Magazine. My name is Daniel Denvir and I’m temporarily broadcasting from Santiago de Chile, but by the time you hear this I’ll be back in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it that you find so disturbing about commercial surrogacy? An industry that employs women, often poor women in a poor country, to gestate fetuses carrying the genetic material of more affluent people, often in the West, to whom the baby is then transferred or maybe sold. My guest today is Sophie Lewis and she argues in her new book,Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family,
that something is deeply wrong with commercial surrogacy. But it’s just not what you might think. What’s wrong is the brute labor exploitation taking place at the reproductive crossroads of a racial global capitalist order, a system of racial capitalism that mystifies labor across the board. And that in the case of commercial surrogacy mystically celebrates brown women’s creation of “white babies.” What’s not wrong is the violation of some mythic perfect pregnancy untouched by capitalist market relations. Gestation, Lewis argues, is just one form of labor exploited under capitalism. Indeed she argues that surrogacy prohibitionists rely upon the very idealized icon of the bourgeois family that is itself an organizing principle of the commercial surrogacy market and of capitalism as a whole too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis ruthlessly criticizes every conventional belief about gestating fetuses and making families and demands that you unflinchingly analyze how capitalism dominates people’s lives across the board: in the productive sphere, in the social reproductive background, and in areas like commercial surrogacy that blur the lines between the two, making it clear that the distinction between waged work and home work is one that’s imposed by capitalism rather than given by nature. Anyhow, I promise that this interview is a fascinating and provocative one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and here’s Sophie Lewis, the author ofFull Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family from Verso
. Lewis is a Philadelphia-based theorist, communist, unaffiliated PhD, affiliated with the Out of the Woods ecological writing collective, and an occasional translator, teaching part-time for the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Sophie Lewis, welcome to The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sophie Lewis:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 When I first heard of international commercial surrogacy a few years ago, my initial response was that I was a bit queasy. At the risk of asking you to psychoanalyze me, what was I responding to? And also what is commercial surrogacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Those are two good opening questions actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Being hyper-honest there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, of course. There’s a standard definition that I think is actually good. So I won’t necessarily read it directly out from the book but I will…Let me find it. The thing you’re responding to about gestational surrogacy that makes you queasy is the illusion of an extreme denaturalization of something deeply fundamental, foundational, to nature. The ideology of nature we carry around with ourselves, or the very building blocks of our identification with our humanity, which really works through things like motherhood and where we came from. The commercial gestational surrogacy industry is dystopian in many ways. Those capitalist wage relations being extended into the province of literal baby-making. And the purpose of a commercial surrogacy arrangement is the manufacture of a neonatal human that will be passed as a kind of legal property to a buyer. “The commissioning parents” is the terminology in that industry. You don’t have to be a full-blown anti-surrogacy activist, a “surrogacy abolitionist” as some of the feminists involved call themselves, to find this on some level very repulsive, very repugnant in an almost pre-linguistic way. It’s only when you start to tease apart what’s actually going on, or rather not going on, in this industry, that you can become a bit more comfortable with the idea that this is an industry among industries under capitalism. And, in fact, as the black feminists in the 1980s were saying when the industry started coming along, “nothing new.” Something that, in fact, we are already familiar with without really realizing it. So, what I mean by that is that while on its face commercial gestational surrogacy elicits this reaction of, “That is wrong.” That there’s something deeply wrong about exploiting gestational labor power in the service of economically more powerful biogenetic families. But, as people like Angela Davis were saying, and the legal scholar Anita Allen who wrote an essay called “The Black Surrogate Mother” in the 1980s, that the basics of this relation, as a labor relation, have been foundational certainly to the reproduction of the American private nuclear household for an extremely long time. So while the commercialization and literalization of relationships of surrogacy is a new thing, it’s perhaps better to understand it as a chance for us to become more aware, because of something becoming more obvious, about the foundational constitution of the so-called “natural family.” Kathi Weeks has this line about how the essence of surrogacy is about having figures, shadowy figures, excised from the family photo. And what the black feminist Marxist intervention seems to me to have been in the ’80s was that well, we’re calling this situation that people are making a lot of noise about and feeling a lot of revulsion about “new,” as in new reproductive technologies. But in fact there is nothing new at all about a relationship in which proletarian, often racialized, feminized, laborers are bringing their bodies and labors into the service of a white household. Not always white, but certainly the image under which the bourgeois family has been generalized and often internalized by many other classes is a white image, which relies on a series of “help” meets wet nurses and so on and so forth, who are shadowy figures on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In other words, you argue something is definitely wrong with the commercial surrogacy industry, but it’s just not at all what surrogacy prohibitionists say is wrong with it. You ask, “Is gestational surrogacy intrinsically the apogee of alienation, a violation that can only ever be arranged in different feudal neoliberal settler colonial flavors?” And your answer of course is a strong “No.” You write that this total dystopian vision requires both an obscene celebration of more conventional forms of wage labor under capitalism, at least implicitly, at least by implication, and also the erasure of surrogate workers. My question is: Who are surrogate workers and how do you, as a Marxist feminist, think about their work and the work of anyone gestating a fetus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 People who sign up to be commercial gestational surrogates today might be quite different things. This is also something that is true of other industries, including, for example, sex work. You might have a fairly boutique, if you like, commercial gestational surrogate based in California. She might be someone—this is something that academic papers have identified as a trend—a military wife with great health insurance via the military, who is making use of the absence of said husband on some kind of military deployment and taking advantage of this great obstetric care provision to gestate babies that are the genetic property, in this logic, of a given set of buyers. Or, in some cases, it might be altruistic of course. I confine myself to mainly looking at the commercial side of this new configuration. But sometimes, particularly among the affluent, so-called altruistic (i.e. unpaid) commercial surrogacy arrangements do occur. Or, and this is the majority case, you might be a low income, but not, as a rule, among the lowest income Indian worker. You might be a person in Gujarat, in India, who is otherwise typically employed in garment manufacture or glass crushing, those being the opposite ends of the spectrum of employment generally reported by employees at a given clinic that I use as my case study in the book. You know, you have aspirations. The typical one named is about having a house of your own to raise your own children in. The image of the private property horizon for gestational surrogates in India seems extremely ideological, even pivotal, for the people justifying the outsourcing model of this of this industry. By outsourcing I mean the component whereby people from the Global North travel to the Global South to avail themselves of gestational services that are cheaper there than they would be at home. That’s not the only component of Indian clinics. Indian clinics serve Indian commissioning parents, but the media tends to focus on the sensational visuals of what some scholars have called “cross-racial transnational reproductive tourism.” Where you get one of these gestational employees having a C-section where her boss is lifting a racially “other” baby out of her body. That tends to be the image that gestational surrogacy travels under. You know, with its shock value. So those are the two typical images of a gestational surrogate. A Californian who is being paid perhaps $33,000. I mean, the hubs of the industry are constantly changing. And India has in fact banned, which I found very rude just as my book was going to press, the commercial and homosexual elements of the industry. So currently things in India are up in the air and it’s no longer really…I mean I foresee this changing again, but right now there are actually no––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So how do you, as a Marxist feminist, think about this work and the work of anyone gestating a fetus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, someone gestating a fetus under capitalism, whether they’re doing it for money or not, are creating value for capitalism. Mariarosa Dalla Costa, one of the thinkers associated with the Wages for Housework platform that I draw a lot of my inspiration from in 
Full Surrogacy Now, talks about the capitalist function of the uterus. Which is the function whereby the injunction to produce babies who will become workers is something that robs gestators, which is my term (some people don’t like it) for people who could potentially gestate. One might also say women in that context. I prefer to be more specific. But, yeah, it robs us of our creative capacities and our sex life. So I think gestating is a form of work. This is part of Wages for Housework’s original statement. They said every miscarriage is a workplace accident, which means that pregnancy is work not just in a metaphorical wishy-washy sense, which is what people tend to like to say. “Pregnancy is hard work” is something that people say a lot even as they really ridicule the idea that it is literally an expenditure of labor power involving a unity of design and execution and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because it’s a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes. Right. Exactly. But I’m serious about it, even as other Wages for Housework thinkers have backed away from this particular component of their original intervention. And I think that what commercial surrogates are doing is very much the same thing that unpaid “natural or normal” gestational workers are doing, except it has been appropriated into a capitalist relation of extraction, circulation, accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You write that human life is perhaps “the ultimate commodity fetish.” And you’re citing, I think, anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes there. My question is: First, how does the mystification of the production of life, by way of gestation, fit into a broader Marxist analysis of the mystification of labor in the creation of value more generally? And second, and this is following up on your last comment around Wages for Housework, how have Marxists and Marxist feminists conventionally understood pregnancy and childbirth? And where do you fit into and depart from that history?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I love the way you put that. I think linking the mystification around this construct, “life itself,” with mystification around labor is actually what I’m doing in the book to some extent. I appreciate you showing me that. It’s become particularly apparent to me that this is a book that is touching on a certain sore spot right now for elements of a natalist, far-right, Evangelical, self-designated pro-life, in my view fetus fetishist, movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’ve heard your Twitter mentions have gotten interesting recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Oh boy. Yes. Well, we can talk about that if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 No, no, no. No need. Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I would say that what is invisiblized in the doctrine of life itself is of course the ways in which, and this is where my critical Harawavianism comes in…The ways in which we are implicated in unmaking specific forms of life always, at the same time as we are constructing them and building them, we can’t get away from a certain degree of violence in a sense. There is a responsibility we owe to ourselves and to each other around deciding not to reproduce certain things. And it’s a dimension of labor, including care labor, because I believe that care is creative and makes things. It makes certain worlds. It makes certain futures. It also chooses not to make other things. It chooses to unmake, therefore, other kinds of human being, other forms of sociality. There isn’t a way to be simply pro-life in a politically liberatory way. I am for abortion because I think it’s a good thing. It’s good for people. And also because I support the right to stop doing gestational work, whatever the reason. I see no humane way to advocate for forcing people into a forced labor relation. I think people for whatever reason have a complete right, if you want to frame it in terms of right, to kill the part of themselves that is the fetus in a pregnancy. And what seems to be challenging to my army of trolls at the moment, sent by Tucker Carlson, is that you can think that a fetus and an abortion are questions of health care and of killing at the same time. In Full Surrogacy Now, I zero in on an incredibly overlooked figure called Mary O’Brien, who was one of the only people to really make a forceful case for pregnancy being something that really builds history. And she was a sort of Marxist Hegelian. She was also a Scottish midwife, working-class person, really fascinating figure. And she really could write. I am deeply indebted to Mary O’Brien and her The Politics of Reproduction, which synthesizes a lot of the feminist literature for me, luckily, and takes it to task wherever it doesn’t actually acknowledge the historical, historically contingent, material character of pregnancy sufficiently. So she looks at people like de Beauvoir and Kate Millett and corrects them in a certain sense. Ultimately, I reject Mary O’Brien for having deep blind spots around queerness, around traditions of polymaternalism, around the family, which I do not see as a good thing, around transness, although I recognize that it was very much de rigueur to be transexclusionary among some parts of academia in the 1980s. So my reading of the Marxist approach to gestating takes a very brilliant Marxist feminist, Mary O’Brien, as its guide. She has a lot of zingers to do with the magical ways in which Marxists think children seem to appear spontaneously. The classic view is that literally reproductive––although I prefer to use words like procreative to be clear, for reasons I can––labor “does not produce value, does not produce needs, and therefore does not make history nor make men.” That was her summation of how Marxists see pregnancy. And as a general rule Marxists have also looked at surrogacy and seen it as the epitome of forced alienated labor. And this is because in the phrase of one of these figures, Marvin Glass, “the contracted gestators activity is not spontaneous activity. It belongs to another. It is the loss of self.” So this is something that is particularly, apparently, the case in surrogacy, although it’s clearly also the case in a lot of other kinds of capitalist work. I spend a lot of time considering this as gently as I can and trying to tease out why there is this deep gestational exceptionalism among Marxists when thinking about work and anti-work. And I basically conclude that because we have an actual shop floor here historically, peopled by waged gestational workers who have a politics of their own, have a series of demands, have analysis of what they are doing, it makes absolutely no sense to continue with this kind of moral theorizing, over gestational surrogates’ heads, of this Marxist type, which is basically inconsistent and often amounts to an anti-commodification position that wants to abolish the workplace without abolishing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Let’s pause right there because I think we should explain, before we get any further, the distinction you’re making between work and labor. Lay out that distinction and what labor, including gestation and going into labor, might look like if it wasn’t work because we lived in an emancipated society. Because you argue for a struggle against, and for the abolition of, work and value. But obviously humans will always have to toil, even under a much better system. So explain the distinction you’re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Oh, it’s quite simple. My sense is that labor is a good word for the activities we perform that interact with non-human elements of nature. We will be stuck with that no matter what. Work is a useful term I find for the stealing of those processes in capitalist relations. I’m thinking of this line by Silvia Federici, which is that nothing so successfully stifles our lives as the transformation into work of those activities and relations that most satisfy our desires. So the transformation into work of labors that we could be otherwise doing out of a kind of desire. Even potentially toilet cleaning might be something that we could have a desire to do were we not compelled to do it for alienating reasons, under a world governed by profit and value. When I say work I’m talking about something that I want to, as you say, abolish. But that doesn’t mean that I think it will vanish. I don’t think we will be left, even in an utopian situation, with no work, unfortunately. I think we will be left with some sort of unpleasant kind of––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Some drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. The thing about gestational work which is deeply alienated in a world where, and this is the Dalla Costa point, the product you’re creating is going to be immediately stolen by the capitalist class and by capital itself. This would be deeply different––Mary O’Brien has a very cryptic but very suggestive line, which is that in a society liberated from capitalism and patriarchy “children will be different.” My sense is that would be the case, partly because children’s liberation will have returned to the sensibilities of progressives and revolutionaries. This thing that has kind of been lost sight of but used to be theorized by people like Shulasmith Firestone, who saw the private nuclear household as somewhere where women and children are produced as workers and who can only really get their freedom together by abolishing themselves as such. Gestational labor is scary, as well as other things. This is also something I think I’ve been liable to be misunderstood about. I open my book and continue towards the end of it with a description of the technicalities and mechanics of hemochorial placentation, which is the biological term for the setup we have as mammal homo sapiens. A deeply unfortunate placenta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I would say you open your book on a––there is a kind of interesting structure to the tone of your book, where you open on what feels like a strategically anti-natalist, anti-childbirth note. You talk about pregnancy’s little discussed morbidity, how “bio-physically speaking gestating is an unconscionably destructive business.” You even suggest that pregnancy is a cancer of sorts. But then, you end the book by arguing that gestation and childbirth already contain within them a queer communist horizon because they break down this notion of unitary human individuals. And you point to surrogacy and how it demonstrates that the uterus is nobly indifferent to the DNA of the fetus it gestates. I take it the structure wasn’t an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, yeah. Even in the beginning I think, I hope I convey a certain kind of ambivalence about extreme sports like gestating. I think in a liberated society of course some people would still want to do things that are internally ravaging and dangerous. I mean, look, I’m kind of a pervert. I hope other people are too. There’s something deeply exciting and sublime and strange about being invaded from the inside, like by something that you can’t really simply choose to let go of. Unlike in other species where, as I detail, pregnancies tend to be something that can actually be dropped without undue damage. There’s not so high a risk of hemorrhage and so on in other species, which is one of the reasons why it is in our species that the whole question of reproductive rights and justice is so fraught. There is a sort of makeup we have unfortunately (that I believe we could dedicate intensive gestator-led scientific inquiry into attenuating with technology, medicine, all kinds of things) whereby the last thing that will stay alive if a pregnant person runs into some kind of life-threatening difficulty is likely to be the pregnancy. We are rigged in such a way that mama doesn’t come first. I wonder if we could bio-hack that. Unfortunately, the people right now who are leading the charge in pursuing partial automation in pregnancy are not doing so out of a desire to attenuate the burdens of gestational work or multiply the options for people who might want to get together and manufacture a fetus. They are doing so because of their obsessive concern for the fetus, their desire to construct the human fetus as a medical patient, their basic objective being to remove the gestator and their or her inconvenient power. And, as I say, it’s an already really constricted and constrained power, unfortunately, to say no to the fetus, to kill, or to remove that part of her body from herself. And so the goal currently for those who are trying to alleviate and experimentally automate the uterus, which is happening in Philadelphia, by the way. Their objective is not the queer gestational commune. We’re gonna have to really move fast in taking this over from below. Because their goal is actually to “solve the problem of abortion” by making it “unnecessary.” Because a “preemie,” a premature neonate, could, in their scenario, should it prove successful (and there is already FDA approval for many of these sort of bio-bag type prototypes), it would be potentially illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In terms of what you’re just talking out though, one thing that’s striking about commercial surrogacy in India is all of the state-of-the-art health care being provided to surrogate workers who would otherwise be denied quality health care. Which is pretty chilling for a lot of reasons, including extremely high maternal mortality. You write, then, that the problem isn’t the technologization of pregnancy, but instead the social reality within which pregnancy’s technologization already exists, including, but beyond, commercial surrogacy. And the way that technology exists, of course, is within highly unequal capitalist social relations. Explain your take on technology and pregnancy and what sort of broader theory of technology you subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 My perspective on technology in pregnancy is influenced by the xenofeminists, by Donna Haraway, and by certain kinds of black feminist, especially queer black feminists, those inclined towards Afrofuturism and a rejection of the shibboleths of nature as tacitly colonial and/ or settler colonial constructs. My provocative proposal is that all reproduction is assisted. If you think about the implication of the phrase “assisted reproduction,” it’s that some reproduction is unassisted. Whereas people across the political spectrum think they agree with the proposition “it takes a village,” and I extend the notion that it takes a village all the way into the pre-birth term. I think about pregnancy as something that involves a plurality of technics, of actors, of relations, of provisioning, and so on and so forth. So when I think about the so-called “natural birth” or “natural childbirth” movement, which is an ideological and activist formation that has its roots in the post-war period. And was oddly kind of paternalistically led by people including Grantley Dick-Read, a man who went to Africa to discover and report back to the West how black women there experienced no pain and no fear in connection with childbirth and then applied these principles to various schools of childbirth in England and Western Europe and North America. This was obviously one of competing tendencies in this direction, including Lamar’s, which I’m not necessarily trying to reject wholesale. But natural childbirth is a deeply unnatural thing. It has a whole host of approaches and artificial mechanisms within it that you can style your pregnancy according to. And you’re asking about the kind of heuristics I use to think about nature and technology. And, well, I’m trained as a critical geographer, and it’s in geography that Marxists and Eco-Marxists and queer feminists have been denaturalizing the operations of nature for some decades. So when it comes to natural birth, while I’m with Shulasmith Firestone on a whole host of things notwithstanding her blindness to questions of white supremacy, which is very serious, she really hasn’t got it right when she, albeit hilariously, mounts her invective against natural childbirth, and talks about childbirth as something akin to shitting a pumpkin, as the famous phrase has it. She has a wonderful dialogue between herself and the school of the great experience, as she calls it. And she’s completely right about a lot of this. There is a sort of repronormative coercion involved in ideologically placing pregnancy among a series of untouchably sublime experiences. The very true reality that many people experience something sublime when they gestate is then turned into a sort of injunction. I’m not interested in saying that pregnancy is one thing or another. Clearly people have completely different experiences of it. The idea that we shouldn’t have any choice about entering into a situation that is so risky and––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Also that there’s this sense that it’s compulsory that you report joy about pregnancy and having children. Which then makes postpartum depression, which is far more common than post-abortion depression, all the more tricky of a condition to deal with because it’s so highly stigmatized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Precisely. Yes. The construct “natural childbirth,” in practice, is not something I have all that much to quarrel with. There’s a fantastic long-standing grassroots movement of doulas and midwives, and people who are historically the heirs of the witches and Indigenous healers, or multiple reproductive technicians in communities who were expelled from the gestational workplace with the rise of patriarchal and protocapitalist obstetrics. This is a well-known history we find in histories like Federici’s Caliban and the Witch. And of course there are things that involve a certain kind of mystification practiced in some of these movements, but as a rule there are many sorts of queer, cyborg, trans-inclusive practices to be found in the doula-ing movement and they are just quietly getting on with a trans-inclusive approach to reproductive justice. Which is far in advance of the mainstream media’s sense of what is possible within medical practice, particularly in the UK, where I come from. You will find these articles about about how we will be banned from saying breastfeeding and pregnant women et cetera et cetera. In reality you can write books like mine, which uncouple gestating from gender to a large degree. You can quietly just get on as many people have with caring for gestators of more than one gender and the fabric of the universe doesn’t implode. But I will say that my problem with the term “natural,” when it comes to vindicating birthers and gestators, is just that it throws tacitly “unnatural” figures amongst us potentially under the bus. Not necessarily in practice, as I say, but I take from Haraway the notion that technology has been co-constitutive of the human right from the beginning. The notion of the cyborg is the notion that we began to have technics involved in our very flesh as soon as we started cooking food. The idea of an unnatural pregnancy implied by the ideal natural pregnancy is one that presumably involves untoward quantities of assistance or medical intervention and so on. And what people are really, I think, when they’re objecting to something real, rather than just something phobically constructed as weak or uncourageous or something…What they’re reacting to, when it is valid, is simply the wrong kind of alienation. It’s the power relations in the maternity ward, and that’s why I’m not interested in natural versus unnatural. I’m interested in who has the power. So in the context of the so-called womb farm it’s about who’s running the farm. The phrase doesn’t tell me so much in the way that the kind of sensationalist moral critics, who call everything “The Handmaid’s Tale” or whatever, think it tells us. I want to know more about the class relations in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Let’s discuss the concrete world of commercial surrogacy a little more directly, particularly the situation in India, which is a focus of your book and was, at least until perhaps very recently, a center of the global surrogacy economy. What is or was the situation in India? And who is Nayna Patel? Who you mentioned earlier, I believe. This TED-talking Oprah-approved surrogacy clinic owner. Really the apogee, perhaps, of the whole industry. And how does Patel represent her enterprise so as to simultaneously celebrate it as an anti-poverty initiative and as a labor of love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Dr. Nayna Patel is this kind of girlboss who really carved out the discursive space for commercial gestational surrogacy on a world stage. She was one of the first really successful bioclinical capitalists to innovate in this area. But not only that, she was one of the firsts to really take it on to myriad documentaries and talk shows and, as you mentioned, this included Oprah, who was initially skeptical about the exploitation involved but who was entirely sold by Patel’s considerable charisma and ended up pronouncing Patel’s business “women helping women.” I love it. And the reason for picking this clinic as a case study, which is something I’m not alone in doing by any means; I should be clear I did not do ethnography or field research myself. There is an absolute plethora of ethnographies out there. I was really struck by the number of anthropological, sociological, workplace inquiries (although they weren’t called that; that was my spin on it) that have been conducted. Where academics have gone, ideally with some of the local language under their belt, to report back on this extraordinary new “Brave New World” type situation. And as the very well-known philosopher of reproduction Marilyn Strathern put it wryly, there will be no shortage of good copy when it comes to surrogacy. People love to talk about it. They love to do documentaries on it. They love to talk to Nayna Patel in a very superficial way honestly. And respectfully, with some very important exceptions, the academia too is very shallow. It accepts all these premises that people like Patel are saying about the industry. That it’s completely separate from everyday life. That this is something kind of magical, kind of technical, that people like her, in her white coat, can arrange for you to mitigate the extraordinary hardship that is infertility. So Nayna Patel, I don’t know if she has any interest in reading my book. I hope that she doesn’t misunderstand it as some people may, as a pro-surrogacy polemic. It’s true that if you don’t think about the title Full Surrogacy Now at all and ask yourself what “full surrogacy” might mean, it’s an impossible concept. I am interested in something that might be worthy of the name, but we can go into that later. She might potentially think that I’m singing her praises. Of course I actually think she’s––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Not if her reading comprehension is what I…It’s very high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 If you’re listening Nayna, with all due respect, you’re a class enemy and your vision of yourself is megalomaniacal. Maybe I should cut that last bit if it’s libelous. But Nayna Patel has a discourse about what she is doing that literally trades in this vitalist language of life in particular and life itself. She thinks that it is in her hands. A class-flattened exchange of deep fundamental needs belonging to individual women is being trafficked and resolved to everybody’s benefit. So on the one hand you have the tragically childless woman. She may come from the Global North or she may not. And on the other you have this low-income help…A local who is deeply, in this narrative, invested in anti-infertility as a social cause. So the commissioning parents in industrial surrogacy become positioned as a kind of oppressed class, almost akin to exclusions along the lines of race or class or disability or something. And Patel is catering to them because there is nothing more sacred, in her world view, than the desire for a “child of one’s own.” And her hospital is massive. As you say, commercial surrogacy is currently illegal in India. I have to say I foresee that changing swiftly again. Regardless, her profits off the back of her gestational employees have been so significant that she’s been able to complete the construction of a “one stop shop” for all things surrogacy, which is this glittering hospital, the Akanksha. Where on the top floor there is a laboratory in which completely different directions are going to be pursued perhaps in the interim, while surrogacy per se is off the cards. There is so much demand for certain kinds of niche medical banking. You can bank your cord blood. The umbilical cord cells that, according to some new veins of privatized medicine, have special properties for ensuring a specific individual’s health later on in life and so on and so forth. There are these offcuts of pregnancy that Patel can make good capitalist use of in the laboratory and her hospital even as the commercial surrogacy itself is on pause. And what I found so interesting about her place in the surrogacy pantheon is her ability to spin what she’s doing as feminism, very much along the lines of Sheryl Sandberg’s account of what being a feminist means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I want to ask about that in particular. You write that she frames her clinic as doing the same sort of development work that microlending does. It is, in this framing, development as the empowerment of individual women as entrepreneurs of sorts to liberate women from both poverty and patriarchy. Explain how this ideology and rhetoric functions within the Indian and global political economy. Specifically this demonization of working class husbands, sold as a liberation of working class women. Because Patel figures the husband as the oppressor and not herself. And it is Patel, after all, who is the boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 A huge part of the reason why Patel is so eminently televisable and quotable in the West, in the anglophone sphere, including the Indian anglosphere, is because of her snappy, catty, pop feminism. Well, it’s several things at once really. I read it as a form of lean in feminism at the same time as it draws really heavily on traditions of Lady Bountiful-type parochial, noblesse oblige sorts of activities in the colonial Indian context. There are these interviews where she talks about how right from childhood she was deeply passionate about going to “trim the nails and wash the hair” of the local Adivasi populations because of her good breeding and her aristocratic extraction. But it’s something that really operates as a kind of parallel to projects of neoliberal subjectification such as microfinance. The idea being, and this is very much promulgated by organizations like the World Bank and the U.N. and so on, if you empower third world women you are making sound economic investments. This is a plinth of philanthro-capitalism as well. That if you only target the oppressed women of the Global South they will, under your benevolent, humanitarian, feminist gaze, become little entrepreneurs. All they need is a tiny bit of startup capital, and before you know it they’ll be running little chocolate businesses or embroidery shops or whatever. And so there’s this incredible irony here. Patel doesn’t quite have the guts to go the whole distance and frame the actual gestating that her employees are doing as the substantive work in this initiative that she is curating. She starts off by saying that. She has frequently said that being a gestational surrogate is “better work than being a construction worker, a laborer, or a maid.” That’s a quote. But then, as she gets herself mired in the logical implications of this assertion of gestating as a “physical job” (that’s another thing she has said), soon enough she realizes that she’s going to have to talk out of the other side of her mouth and talk about the other things that she puts into her employees hands as the actual work. So while they are in her dormitory, she makes sure that they learn English, or learn how to style hair, or do makeup, or make chocolate, or so on and so forth. And that becomes, what she then slides into saying is the actual job training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Instead of capitalist labor relations, what she wants to present going on is the Indian surrogate worker women not being workers, but doing this beautifully empathetic selfless service for infertile women elsewhere. And then she’s doing this selfless thing by giving them this job training. So it’s actually just this decommodified care economy…Is the way she likes to present it when that suits her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. Which really exposes some of the tensions in the whole girlboss construction. You can be a ruthless business innovator, but doing so literally with uteruses is still something a little bit too much for a global public to swallow. And it’s not what she wants to swallow either. It’s not completely what she wants to see herself as either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And the demonization of working-class husbands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes, of course. Good point. This is another reason why people lap it up. Clients at Dr. Patel’s clinic hear her, in the sound bites broadcast on radio and television, saying in these dramatic speeches she likes to give in her beautiful saris and jewelry to assemblies of her employees, along the lines of “a husband is always a problem.” And everyone gets to giggle. And there are even theater outings that she’s organized for her best employees where they got to see a play which is about a feisty surrogate who is pursuing surrogacy against her husband’s wishes and so on. And Patel gets to absorb the benefits of this illusion of transgression and so on. She is enabling these girls to stick the middle finger up at their husbands in the ways they always wanted to. As though working-class women couldn’t and haven’t always been doing that themselves. And as though saying fuck you to your husbands simply to embrace––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As though they need a rich lady to teach them how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Your boss. Exactly. It’s also deeply ironic in that Patel requires permission from husbands. She doesn’t actually, in any material way, modify the norms of the industry which rely on an infantilization of the gestational surrogate via consent and approval required from husbands and fathers. But via these small moments, these cosmetic elements of demonization of working-class men, she gets to enroll a whole plethora of pseudo-feminist buy-in, both internationally and locally. And it bears no connection whatsoever with her analysis of more affluent men, commissioning fathers, her own husband for example. There is absolutely no sense that the couple form, when it is middle to upper class and coming along to collect a baby from the clinic as its property, that there is any kind of problem with heterosexual marriage or the nuclear household then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Let’s talk about that point a little more. This important thing that you point to is that Patel’s entire enterprise, and in fact the entire enterprise of commercial surrogacy in many ways, at least in this transnational context, is premised upon the endorsement of this powerful and deeply rooted morality tale that naturalizes bourgeois families that want a child, and that intervenes in and stigmatizes the very sort of poor families that commercial surrogate workers come from. And you write that this organizing principle of capitalist political economy is the white middle-class nuclear family. And that, in turn, anchors this quasi-eugenically racialized order that devalues, stigmatizes, polices, separates, and degrades most every other sort of family. Explain the role of the white middle-class family both literally and as an icon, and how that depends upon other mothers being poor. That the ideal of this family can only appear as though it’s built upon noncommercial and noncommodified relationships because it depends on the outsourcing of so much family labor. Sorry that’s a mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Broadly speaking, just to lay it out, I and many others––because this analysis used to be a bit of a mainstay of several strands of women’s liberation thinking, radical feminism, gay liberation, and utopian socialism––believe the family is extremely worthy of abolition. Abolish the family used to be an extremely well-known demand. Why? Because, and I actually don’t go into Engels so much as I go into the black feminist critique, but the analyses dovetail regardless of which wing of the liberation struggle coalition you look at. The nuclear private household, also known as the family, is the site of the overwhelming majority of the sexualized abuse that goes on on planet Earth. It is not the haven for many people that it is set up to be by the family values shibboleths. It is also a really crucial building block for capitalism and that includes neoliberal and neoconservative brands of capitalism. As Melinda Cooper lays out in her book, the answer to the thesis which we find frequently on the left that capitalism has already abolished the family or whatever is no, not at all. The unit of order for contemporary capitalist regimes, just as it was for earlier ones, is the family in perpetual crisis. It is in fact the idea that the family is falling apart that gives a lot of energy and fuel to policies that inject or purport to inject new life into that unit, always at the expense of others, be it queers, refugees from the family as it were. And don’t forget, queer youth are frequently literal lethal victims of the so-called family and their individual families, which requires a whole host of reparative and humanitarian organizations, many of them just voluntary. Many of them just activist forms of social reproduction and rescue for queer youth. But also migrants, people dispossessed for any kind of reason, and particularly racial reasons, from the dividends that accrue to the standard normative family. The system that naturalizes this image of the family in the Global North. By naturalizes I mean constructs it as something we think of as naturally occurring, even self-sustaining. It’s a whole project that invisibilizes and mystifies the way in which all kinds of others are actually being dispossessed of that family form in order to maintain it. And this is something that you see when you pick apart the transaction at the heart of Nayna Patel’s business. There are other people who have to do deeply unfamilial things under the aegis of a desire to be part of that normative family ideal, in order to materially provide for the needs of families in the Global North. Particularly white ones. That basic global care chain is something that Kalindi Vora takes on in her book 
Life Support, and she has a new one out co-written with Neda Atanasoski, called 
Surrogate Humanity. That’s a very deeply ingrained operation of contemporary biocapital. It’s this way in which everyone is encouraged ghoulishly to buy into a fundamentally stratifying and chasmic universalist bargain around the ideal of the universal family that everyone can have. In fact, no. It’s literally impossible for everyone to have that. Because on a colonial and class basis, a great deal of us are laboring impossibly to achieve something that we will never get out of, our efforts to provide for people the private nuclear households of the ruling class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You argue that commercial surrogacy is premised on the impossible task of having a baby for someone else. An extreme manifestation, you argue, of the standard fiction that babies belong to anyone at all. And you write that this is a fiction not only socially but also biologically. And then more specifically you write that the commercial surrogacy industry is premised on brown women being able to make white babies, and in the fiction that those white babies will not be tainted by a racial, class, or national other. The contamination of that other. Explain these fictions you’re writing against and also your argument about babies in truth belonging to no one at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One of the ironies to dispel right off the bat about so-called surrogacy, this so-called “new,” in actuality not new at all reproductive technology, which is actually just human labor––it’s actually just pregnancy––is that it is something that disturbs, transgresses, or if you’re really techno-utopian and uncritical of capitalism, then queers the family or something. Some of my critics, who don’t read me, I think take it that I somehow think that actually existing surrogacy queers the biogenetic standard of the natural family. And this is not just not what I say. It would be absurd to say that. Because commercial surrogacy as an industry is where you find the most virulent assertions of the idea that a baby is the property of its genetic commissioners. It’s the opposite of an anti-familial zone in that sense. It’s where the most––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The ultimate of the ultimate commodity fetish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. So it’s useful to look to that sphere, because what is happening there is in any way transgressive in and of itself, yet quite the contrary. But because some of those assertions about reproduction taking place, they are by virtue of their virulence potentially open for unsettling. So what surrogacy can tell us about pregnancy and reproduction is open for contestation I think. As you say, there is something provocative about the spectacle of a white baby coming out of a brown body. Nayana Patel is prone to making ontological statements about the guaranteed and stable character of race as a biological immutability. In these moments she has said things like “pure white. Pure European. You can always tell.” And it’s really fascinating to try and unpack what she means there by “you can always tell.” This is a body that a second ago was part of another body. Where did that body come from? In what way is it in fact distinct from the gestator? And it is extremely striking to witness the choreographies in play in that medical context because Patel will lift the baby out and then say, “bring the baby to its mother.” The mother is not the person lying there. It’s the person waiting outside in the waiting room. And those constructions are crucial for the profit-making that Patel is wedded to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And part of this is emphasizing DNA in a way that crowds out other biological materials that are in fact, biologically speaking, constitutive of who a human is or what a human is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. There is a robust tradition of Marxist and socialist biologists, and also of feminist socialist ones, not to mention anti-colonial readings of science and particularly of genetics, that tells us that DNA is not self-reproducing. It doesn’t make things. And it is vastly overestimated and vastly overinvested in as a promise of the coded algorithmic replication of self amongst humans. In my book I have a moment where I share a personal memory that, in my view, constitutes the origin of my interest in the blackmail that is the notion of genetic predetermination, inheritance, and progeny. It’s a memory of sitting in the back seat of the car with my nuclear family, my father and my mother in the front. We had just seen a play and I asked precociously from the back seat, musing about the themes of that play, how it made any sense. Because obviously, Dad, if you were to suddenly find out that my brother and I were technically genetically the children of the milkman you wouldn’t suddenly love us any less would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I was going to say pool boy, but milkman, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You wouldn’t suddenly love us any less, Dad? was a rhetorical question, but unfortunately I got this real answer in the form of a really sickening silence that struck me dumb. I couldn’t speak for the rest of that car ride and I think it’s been the origin of my curiosity about the violence and the scarcity and, as I say, blackmail implicit in the notion that the given relations of blood are those that will matter most to you, the only ones that will be there for you, and the ones to which you will be beholden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One related key contradiction in the way that commercial surrogacy fits within this racialized global reproductive order is how it transforms Indian women’s fertility from a problem for the world, into a solution for affluent white women’s infertility. What’s your analysis of the significance of it being Indian women, who for so long have been a central focus of eugenic populationist anxiety and intervention. That they now find themselves at the center of commercial surrogacy, making so-called white babies. It’s pretty weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, absolutely. Of course, there are other hubs of the industry including Kenya, Guatemala, Laos, and until recently, Thailand. But as you say it is non-innocent, in my view, that it is in India that this source of productive or so-called reproductive labor power has been harnessed to such incredibly profitable ends. I would defer partly to the wonderful scholar Sharmila Rudrappa, whose book 
Discounted Life is partly about this deep irony that those same populations targeted by sterilization under Indira Gandhi are now the ones that are enrolled in the assistance of others’ reproduction. It’s non-innocent because, in a sense, this is where the capitalist market has the greatest surplus to reap. Very few Indian women in the aggregate access healthcare workers in their lifetime. There is a deeply devalued quantum of the gestational labor power in play. And what happens when capitalists move in, in this population, is they can take what has been cheapened to a deeper degree than any other gestational labor power on earth almost. And it can enroll that in a matrix of high-end, world-class obstetric care, which has the side effect of really pulling the wool over the workers eyes in that they become bought in in some cases, at least initially, to the idea that surrogacy and normal pregnancy are completely different things. Because how could it not be. Because look at all the injections, look at all the applications of vitamins, look at all the scans, look at…There is nothing similar about a gestational surrogate in India’s typical experience of a surrogate pregnancy and her non-surrogate prior pregnancy that generated her daughters and/ or sons. Which is why it takes more than one cycle of surrogate pregnancy for many of these workers to actually realize that this is very much pregnancy. A body treats an embryo containing genetic material of the gestator and somebody else much the same as it does an embryo containing a stranger’s genetic material. Genetics just isn’t really that big of a deal for a human body. We are also epigenetically shaped. Donna Haraway provocatively says that reproduction doesn’t really occur in species that carry out sexual reproduction. DNA gets scrambled more than it does get passed on. And so for people like my dad, incredibly invested in the idea that they are making copies of themselves, we’ve got bad news for you from socialist feminist biology. This is very much a myth. And, of course, you can take this further. You can look at the ways in which we are porous and leaky and very much filled with organisms that are crucial to sustaining us. We are in a sense being gestated by microorganisms, which is a subject taken up by artists including Patricia Piccinni, who likes to show the invisible alien surrogates who are always already up in your business, spooning your children and mothering them alongside you. Because the fictions of bounded, clean, uncontaminated biogenetic procreation are just that. They are really fictions. And the surrogacy industry is all about the extraordinarily audacious rhetorical move of literally lifting out the flesh and blood and viscera from the abdomen of a worker and telling you that nothing about that worker remains. That no trace of her is going to stick to the baby that you carry away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As if there could be something less antiseptic than gestation and birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I want to talk more about the current of feminists who support criminalizing commercial surrogacy. It emanates, generally speaking, from this certain current that also opposes trans women and sex work, called so-called “radical feminism.” Explain what so-called “radical feminism” is, its origins and trajectory, and its fierce commitment to defending womanhood as what you call a sex class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s a shifting field. Radfem, as it is sometimes still called, despite not being radical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s sort of unfortunate. The name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It can also be designated as “cultural feminism,” Although that doesn’t really immediately tell you so much. It’s the phrase of Alice Echols, a historian of 
Daring to be Bad: Radical Feminism in America 1967-1975, and it’s a very instructive history because she posits that this particular formation that we are now seeing, all these years on, still dominating a lot of spaces hegemonically, particularly in the UK. It’s the phobic traumatized, in a certain sense, residual of the collapse of the second wave that has become the only thing that people think of when they hear the term radical feminism. So it’s actually the case that some women’s liberation factions were virulently opposed to this strand of thinking at the time in the late ’60s early ’70s. There were trans-inclusive second-wave feminisms for example. But what Alice Echols calls “cultural feminism” or what can also be called ontologically-oriented feminism, oriented ontologically towards the idea of the female as a biological and trans-historical constant, subject in an almost metaphysical sense to something they call “female erasure.” It’s something that was a minority but had the good fortune of not collapsing to the same extent that other parts of the second-wave moment did. And that’s got to write history a little bit on behalf of those other feminisms and––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Is that because it was more conducive to neoliberalism? Or more copacetic with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely, yeah. Despite thinking of itself as radical, this particular strand of feminism works incredibly well together with various forms of neoliberal and/ or neoconservative reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because it just so happens to frequently share priorities with the religious right as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s right, yeah. In the mid ’80s people were already saying that the abolitionist anti-surrogacy project was “in bed with church men.” And that the victories that a certain kind of radfem, ecofem opposition to reproductive engineering and reproductive technology shouldn’t necessarily be chalked up to its feminism, but rather to the fact that it was saying the same thing as the Catholic Church. And the ties between right-wing and sometimes even far-right entities, and actors, and sources of funding, and this particular front of feminist struggle––these were laid down in the ’80s by cultural feminism and then continue, or have had a resurgence, in the 21st century in the form of collaborations between trans-exclusionary British feminists and the Heritage Foundation in Washington D.C. Or pro-life interests such as the Center for Bioethics and Culture in the US and the European activists who are trying to criminalize surrogacy in The Hague or at the level of the UN. So we’re having a second round of radfem pro-life alliance. And that’s not to say that everyone involved in opposing surrogacy for feminist reasons in the ’80s was doing so for these kinds of reasons. There were actually dissenting voices within many of the networks. I don’t want to ignore those. But a lot of the key players were leading the charge against surrogacy as a form of commodification, and even as they had no problem saying “slavery.” They are the same exact people who have authored the most brutally transphobic parts of feminist philosophy. And they have spearheaded the rescue industry, with its deeply damaging to sex workers anti-prostitution policies. So the exclusionary radical feminist international, the TERFs, the SWERFs, are joined by what I propose is a SERF component. Surrogate exclusionary radical feminists who have no interest in actually identifying with, relating to, or, God forbid, speaking to the people in question that they want to rescue from their bondage. They want to speak over their heads about the deeply anti-human commodification that they are, according to them, suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As you just alluded to, for these feminists, pregnancy is special in a similar way to how sex is special and so both commercial surrogacy and sex work are for them violations of something sacred. You write, however, “Their problem, as they make it known, is more abstract, more fundamental than these aspects. The elision between exploitation and rape.” That’s a powerful, but very complex argument. Explain what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Although it takes some steps to argue this, my sense, looking at the TERFs the SWERFs and the SERFs, and particularly thinking about the division of pregnancy espoused by the latter, is that the common thread…The problem at the heart of this truncated form of anti-capitalism is its vision of work as something that can be redeemed and enjoyed and in fact should be. The idea behind the rad feminist analysis of surrogacy as a kind of ultimate––the deepest form of capitalist violence that could ever be, is this idea that there is a moral obligation on us. And by us I guess I mean women, because that’s who they’re talking about. To lift ourselves out of the muck of forms of degradation that are in fact instituted by capitalism and colonialism and not within our individual control. It’s striking to me that there isn’t a conceptual equivalent for these feminists of rape culture when it comes to pregnancy. So one could speculate, why don’t they talk about gestational injury culture or something? Strangely enough there is a lot of feminist analysis, some of which the very same people are actually partial to when they’re talking about something else in a different conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You have a similar brand of feminism that both says heterosexual sex under patriarchy is impossible, so all heterosexual sex is rape. But who then suggests that basically gestating for wage labor is even more rape or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes, it’s funny. There’s something deeply pessimistic about this willingness to talk about the lot of women in the household, in marriages with men, and even in the obstetric situation that most people experience in capitalist societies, as violent. But then when it comes to the enrollment of gestating bodies in a capitalist situation directly, a formal capitalist situation, rather than an informal indirectly mediated one, i.e. the household. Remember the household is also for me a sphere of gestational work. But as soon as it gets enrolled in a formal relation for these people, they forget all their critiques of everything that’s bad about pregnancy, motherhood, marriage, et cetera. That all goes out the window and suddenly you get the impression that something deeply beautiful is being desecrated. And I want to be clear. I’m not simply trying to do a blunt negation of the anti-surrogacy abolitionists critiques. Everything I say in the book about what’s bad about the industry overlaps with some of what they say. There is terrible lack of consent practices, there is deeply awful circumstances around bodily autonomy for surrogate workers. A lot of what they’re saying about the industry being bad is stuff that I also say, and go out of my way to say, in the book. But for them there is something beyond that, something metaphysical about the reduction of the human to a commodity that they believe is being singularly affected in this domain and not in others. And that’s a kind of moral and bioconservative and strangely pessimistic analysis of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And certainly not a Marxist one because when it’s either rape and slavery versus pure consent and freedom they’re missing the question of the freeness of wage labor. Which in the Marxist sense workers are doubly free. They’re free to work, but they’re free to starve if they don’t work. So there’s a nuance that they can’t quite take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, precisely. And the other element of Marxist praxis that they miss is that having a problem with an industry is no reason whatsoever to try and quash the ability of workers in that industry to fight in and against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Just like with garment workers. The question isn’t whether you’re pro-textiles or anti-textiles, it’s whether you’re in solidarity with garment workers struggles or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And you don’t typically see people taking garment workers to be proponents of fashion or something. This sort of sensibility is missing from our account of gestational workers. But at the same time I do actually want to say that there are things we can glimpse about an alternative form of kinship in the accounts of these workers. The similarities and differences and realizations that can grow from the side by side experience of so-called surrogate and so-called non-surrogate baby making. There are unique perspectives that are being thrown up by history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You make gestational surrogacy into both a model and a metaphor of sorts, calling for a form of surrogacy that would respond to the very real problems of pregnancy rather than to the demand for genetic parenthood in the context of a global capitalist system that exploits a flexiblized global labor force. You not only turn the surrogacy debate on its head but you also hijack it to make this much more radical argument for the abolition of the family and for, I don’t know, communistic kinship? Is that the right phrase?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s exactly right. There’s a sense in which despite having not really read any Hegel I am given to understand, partly because I’m at the end of a book tour at the moment, at the time of recording, I’ve just been learning what my book says from a whole variety of different people, which has been an incredible privilege. But it seems to me that I’m doing an accidental Hegelian move by positing that only families will abolish the family and only a real surrogacy could abolish surrogacy trademark as it were. This impoverished vision of what surrogacy means that contemporary biocapitalism has instituted, which is actually the least surrogate thing ever as I try to explain. There is so little real solidarity; real appreciation for how distributed and entangled and dependent on each other, literally co-constituted by each other, human bodies are in the surrogacy industry. There’s this famous quote from Gandhi where he was asked what he thought of Western civilization. And he said, I think it would be a very good idea. By the same token I think something like full surrogacy, although it is an unthinkable level of utopia, is something we should be bearing in mind when we think about how to organize our most intimate relations. Full surrogacy would be a situation where the authentic, original, authorized version of a relationship was no longer thinkable. There wouldn’t be anything to be surrogate to, because people would understand themselves as the product of many mothers and many people transgenerationally generally. And this is kind of already a latent reality. I understand the bedrock of life, although it is stolen and atomized and segregated by capitalist social relations, to be this much more tentacular, watery bed of comradely symbiogenesis, to use a Haraway word. Symbiogenesis being a very long, complicated word to designate the process of becoming and making with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I.e. actually existing kinship relationships that are anti or non-normative, however unintentionally. I want to try arguing another side of this, to ask the question I think some listeners might ask, which is: I wonder if the call for abolishing “the family” could miss something about how families, as they exist, can be not just these bleak Althusserian institutions that are totally instrumentalized by the reigning order to impose gender, class, and racial hierarchies, but also places of refuge, love, and resistance? In other words, does your provocative call for the abolition of the family, which I’m convinced by in many ways, does it politically risk making some people think that what you want to abolish includes the parts of their families that they like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, it does risk that, doesn’t it. It’s a very emotionally scary topic. One thing I’ve been learning on the road is that it’s best to be completely emotionally open about how scary this stuff is. I understand another part of Hegel to be a question of how we recognize ourselves only in a way through these institutions––the family and work, for example. And it is vertiginous to the point of actual unbearability to try and think oneself into a situation completely outside of what we currently think of as the family. I think it may be easier to imagine the end of capitalism than the end of the family, to coin a phrase, a much overused one. There is something about the phrase “family abolition” that I am still persuaded by. I think that includes its seeming––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Its provocativeness does political work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, and I noticed that I was doing this placatory square quoting with my fingers around the phrase the family in order to signal to people in my talks that I’m not coming for your husband or your children. And then that was pointed out to me, and it’s a funny one. It’s simultaneously true that I’m not coming for those relations that––whoever you are out there, hi––you may have that are given to you in formats––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You don’t have to hate your mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. In fact, I very much hope that you have comradely liberatory forms of care within your so-called biofam. The xenofeminists have a category called xenofam, which they propose is equal to or greater than biofam. But crucially, your literal mother, father, uncle, aunt, whatever, may be just as respectful of your strangeness and your intimacy and your deserving of multiple sorts of, not just deserving, your need for, your right to multiple relations as any kind of more politically chosen commitment and engagement. Biofam can be equal to xenofam as they say, the xenofeminists. So yeah, there is a risk. And, of course, we are in this moment where “keep families together” and “stop family separation” are these enormous rubrics by which the anti-Trump resistance are acting by. And I’m far from the first to point out that there are limits to these slogans. They throw migrants under the bus who aren’t affiliated to a biological unit that can be interpreted legally by the genocidal border regime as a family. And they throw refugees from the nuclear family under the bus. For instance, it’s perfectly possible to deport youths to their deaths under the rubric “stop family separation,” “families belong together.” You don’t have to be an expert in queer theory to understand why, for some people, “keep families together” is a literally homicidal notion. The family is a very unsafe place for many of us. It’s where people are likely to get killed and/ or raped et cetera. At the same time, obviously those strategic uses, when negotiating with the status quo in a historical moment where aping the forms of the marriage-based nuclear family…Being able to somehow pass a mooted biogenetic test that the Trump administration wants to apply to migrants at the Mexico-American border. They literally want to do a DNA test to guard against “fake families,” which hawks right back to the policy in the ’50s of testing applicants for Chinese American citizenship where tests were implemented to disqualify vast swathes of people who were said to be “paper sons” or “paper daughters” of Chinese American naturalized people. And there’s been great scholarship on that, showing how that was a textbook imposition of a certain kind of structurally colonial notion of biogenetic familiarity. Because many of the so-called paper sons and daughters trying to migrate to America from China were actually real, as it were. Although, you want to avoid this kind of language. But they had kinship bonds that were substantive, just not genetic, with the people that they were trying to join. So basically I think what I’m trying to get out here is the idea that there is nothing ultimately in biogenetic forms of legitimation of caring relationships that serves liberatory ends in the immediate term and under a status quo that systematically tries to tear children from racialized and proletarian parents, especially mothers. There are of course situations in which the assertion of “blood ties” can be beneficial. But I think in the long run there is a deep need to really push against the epistemic boundaries of any kind of notion of “the good life” predicated on the logicality, and naturalness, and self-reproducingness, and automatic worthiness of protection of “the biological” when it comes to human beings. We can say, “people don’t belong in cages.” We can say, “people should never be separated from one another by the state.” We can say, “people belong together.” The history of utopian socialism is partly defined by this fight over the value of the family and so-called working families. For instance, Brecht was taken to task by some of his comrades for his commitment to the abolition of the working-class family. And I think that’s something that I, amongst others, am currently reviving.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For much of the 20th century, Cold War politics defined socialism as the antithesis of democracy. Today, an insurgent democratic socialist movement is transforming US politics. It is socialism that is at the forefront of a fight for a radical deepening of democracy, one in which ordinary people exercise control over our political, economic and social lives—and one in which the people is expansively defined to include those excluded by racist immigration law and mass incarceration. Dan discusses this, and more, with filmmaker and writer Astra Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our History is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipelineand the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our History is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Nick Estes, welcome to The Dig. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Estes:Thanks for having me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You write that the mobilization against the Dakota Access Pipeline marked an “historic resistance in resurgent Indigenous histories, not seen for generations, if ever.” To open this interview, explain what the movement at Standing Rock was about and why you assign it such an important role in the long sweep of Indigenous history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Standing Rock was two things: first, it was a movement within a moment of history, but it was also a moment within a longer movement of history. And what I mean by that is that Standing Rock occurred at a time at the tail end of Obama’s presidency and at the height of the North American oil boom, in the sense that there had been historic resistance leading up to Standing Rock. And so, in many ways, Standing Rock is seen as this moment of exceptional Indigenous resistance. But if we look at it within a longer context, even just within a decade, there was historic resistance in the Alberta Tar Sands region around the extraction of oil sands and the creation of new pipeline infrastructure, such as the Keystone XL pipeline, leading into the Bakken oil boom, which really took off in 2007 and 2008. So there was an infrastructure in place of Indigenous peoples making alliances along these pipeline routes. So in that sense, it’s a longer moment within a longer movement of history. And the longer movement of history is two centuries of Indigenous resistance, going back to the first time we encountered Lewis and Clark on the Missouri River in 1804, all the way through the Plains Indian Wars of the 19th century, the damming of the river in the 20th century, the rise of Red Power, and then the North American oil boom. There are foreign invasions, so to speak, that I trace. And the first one would be the fur trade, beginning at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, going into the expansion of the Transcontinental Railroad, the slaughter of the buffalo in the mid-19th century, to the damming of the river in the mid-20th century, to the fourth invasion, which would be the North American oil boom. And so Standing Rock is, in my opinion, one of those high points of resistance and the coalescence of not just disparate forces that are in the climate justice movement, but the coalescence of history itself on that land and on that river. The reason why Standing Rock is important is that we think of imperialism often in the context of overseas empire, and I was really in conversation with a lot of anti-imperialist scholars such as Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Manu Karuka, who has a recent book out called. And Manu Karuka is much more clear about this, in the sense that he calls it territorial imperialism. And I think if we think about it in that context, we can actually think about settler colonialism as imperialist expansion and annexation. And thus, we can think about Indigenous resistance as the first anti-imperialist resistance in North America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Another question along those lines, to set up some context; settler colonialism, you write, “is a project that’s fundamentally about replacement and genocide.” And a sort of perverse irony of this is that these are the very features of settler colonialism that, in turn, naturalize and legitimate settler colonialism by making the settlement of the United States, or elsewhere, seem normal and inevitable, pushing the bloody foundational moments into the background. Explain why an analysis of, and also struggle against, not only capitalism, but also colonialism, is necessary, not only historically, but also in the present, given the complex and intertwined social, economic, and ecological threats that we face today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Oftentimes, settler colonialism is historicized as something that happened in the past. Where I think a lot of scholars, activists, and organizers are really making interventions into that conversation is to think about settler colonialism as an ongoing project that is also incomplete. Because if it was a complete project and if it was fulfilled, then why would you still need to expropriate Indigenous land bases? And why would we still be fighting these forces of capitalism embodied within the infrastructures of oil pipelines or sites of extraction, such as the Alberta Tar Sands? And so, in many ways, the coalescence of forces at Standing Rock really are an echo of past Indigenous resistance. And if we can think about this notion of climate change and even––I hate to use the word the Anthropocene; I’m very critical of that. But I think this idea that we are undergoing this radical transformation globally and we’re all experiencing it. I think where Indigenous people and Indigenous history play an important role is to say that we are post-apocalyptic nations. We’ve undergone several rounds of genocide, and that genocide isn’t just for Indigenous people. It’s not just anthropocentric. In the context of settler colonialism oftentimes we think of genocide as targeting humans alone, but, as we can see and as I tried to detail in my book, it’s not an anthropocentric project and it also targets non-humans and we can see that specifically, in a clear example, with the Buffalo Nations. It’s not just some kind of ahistorical or mystical reading of history to say that Indigenous peoples have relations with the non-human world. I think there’s a tendency when we say that that there’s this kind of flute music that begins playing and obscures–– we call it the “Indian flute music syndrome.” You can be talking about the most urgent political tasks that we’re facing as Indigenous people––overcoming climate change––and people are floored by it. And then you start playing Indigenous flute music, and it’s as if they just didn’t hear anything else that happened before that. So, there’s a tendency to look at these relations with the non-human world in this mystical or ahistorical or metaphysical way, which actually, in many ways, is part of the erasure and the racialization of Indigenous people. It creates this kind of ethno-othering, where we just become ethnographic subjects. We try to refuse that ethnographic framing and to say that we don’t need to make these spiritual connections to water to say that we, as human beings, have a right to clean drinking water. That should just be the framework that we’re using. Since we’re not legible in that framework, and we’re not legible in that human rights-based framework in the United States, we tend to get collapsed into this spiritual connection to the land and to the water. And so that’s why the urgent task of our present is to look at history within a materialist framework and, as Marx and Engels call, historical materialism. And to say that where we get our water, where we get our food, and our relationship with the land fundamentally determines the quality of life that we live, or the quality of life that we don’t live, as Indigenous peoples. And it’s a radical thing to say, but why is that radical? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:That’s such an important point––that there’s this entire racialized vision of Indigenous spirituality when talking about Indigenous relationships with non-human nature. But it’s a very fundamentally material set of relationships. And going back to the 19th century, you write that river trade forts were, in a sense, the first man camps, part of an extractive model that is today replicated in the fracking boom. And you wrote that this model combines violence against the earth with violence against women, creating these sharp dichotomies between human and non-human nature on the one hand, and between genders as well. Explain the argument that you’re making about colonialist and capitalist approaches to land, to non-human nature, and to gender, and how this has repeatedly played out for and been resisted by the Oceti Sakowin and their own set of relationships which, as you just pointed out, are not only symbolic but deeply material with non-human nature, land, and gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:I am a big fan of Silvia Federici and her book,. Most people talk about one part of that book, but they don’t talk about the other part of that book. And the one part of the book that she’s really known for is the enclosures in Europe and the targeting specifically of Indigenous women’s political authority within communal European society, peasant women specifically, and the proletarianization of the European peasantry into the capitalist system. The one part that often doesn’t get talked about is the Caliban part. The other part of that title, which is the same processes happening in the Americas with the discovery of the “New World” by European explorers and the penetration of capitalism into what is arguably or ostensibly a non-capitalist Indigenous society. And so in one sense I think there’s a romanticization of Indigenous people, and even peasant communal society, as being “socialist” or “communist.” But I would say that they are socialist or communist, not in opposition to capitalism, but in the absence of capitalism. There wasn’t this profit motive that naturally existed. And so, looking at the Northern Plains in this way, we can see that capitalism penetrates new territory, especially Indigenous territory, with violence. And that violence is very gendered. With the arrival of the river trade forts, you have the arrival of the first Europeans, who come entirely as groups of men. We understand what the word “man camps” means. And it’s often associated with extractive industries and the oil and gas industry, where they’re kind of transient, temporary settlements, often near Indigenous reservations or Indigenous communities, where they prey on Indigenous women and they exploit the jurisdictional patchwork of Indigenous reservation land (which is federal, state, and tribal), because we don’t have the ability to prosecute non-Natives oftentimes on reservations. But if we look historically, man camps were the first river trade forts and the outposts in our territory. And you can see that in evidence in popular culture, such as in the movie The Revenant, where you have Hugh Glass, who is a real historical figure played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who we kind of joke around as “Dances With Bears” and he “goes Native,” so to speak. And that whole part is completely fictionalized. He never had Indigenous children as far as we know. But nonetheless what is very historically accurate, and what the director depicts with great historical accuracy, is the immense amount of violence and militarization of the river trade and the fur trade. For example, in the final scene Hugh Glass is coming to settle accounts with the people who left him to die after he got mauled by the bear. And he approaches this river trade fort where there are French traders, English traders, and some American traders. And outside of that trade fort he sees Indigenous men, Indigenous children, and women begging. And also he sees Indigenous women being bought and sold like chattel inside the forts themselves. And so what this tells us is that gender violence was one of the key tools of colonialism at that time. The fur trade was as much a trade in furs as it was a trade in flesh. And it’s often not how that historiography depicts that time period. To my mind, it’s such a travesty and, to be honest, I’m not an 18th century or 19th century historian. It’s not what I am trained in. It’s not what I specialize in. So when I went back and read the historiography of that time period I was actually appalled because they were making excuses. They were saying, in these instances of clear documented rape within traders’ journals and within the primary documents, these historians were saying, “well, you know, it was a different time so we can’t really call it rape.” To me that was such an oversight on part of how we understand that time period. It’s not to say that history repeats itself, but there certainly are echoes of that history in the present time. So we can see that the new rounds of accumulation––the first round of accumulation was the river trade. The second round of accumulation was the advance of what we now know as classic settler colonialism and the privatization of land, often using rail lines or transportation routes to penetrate Indigenous territories that were marked by trade forts, military forts, and outposts. So we can look on the landscape where I’m from and you can see that Indian Reservation headquarters are typically named after the fort that was there. So Standing Rock is Fort Yates; that’s the headquarter. Crow Creek, where I have family from, which is right across the river from Lower Brule, is called Fort Thompson. The pier across from our state capital in South Dakota is Fort Pierre, the Anglicized version of Pierre. We can look at the landscape as very much militarized in that context. And, thinking about the third round of accumulation, which would be the creation of the dams, which was implemented by a branch of the U.S. military, which is the Army Corps of Engineers. So thinking about this, and the penetration of capital, and how it goes hand-in-hand with the state, and the state is the handmaiden of capital in that sense. To just go back to the fur trade forts and the way that traders used Indigenous women’s bodies to gain access to new markets, there’s this thesis that’s been promoted within Indigenous history to say that the fur trade era created “middle grounds” in which Native people and settlers or traders negotiated invasion or negotiated settlement and that they weren’t partners necessarily, but they were kind of equals and one didn’t overpower the other. And I think that’s a false rendering of history because we didn’t send traders into European societies and married only European women. It’s such a bizarre framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:That erases the entire context of encroaching settler colonialism and the subordination of Indigenous nations into settler colonialist capitalist market relations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE: Absolutely, and it also erases intent. Why were these people going to this place to begin with? You know, if we look at rivers as the original highways West, all roads in our region lead to Saint Louis, which was a military outpost. It’s where the army of the West was sent following reconstruction, following the Civil War. It was where Custer was stationed. It was where all of these Civil War veterans went. But it was also a place where you had French aristocracy, who had made riches off of the fur trade, who established themselves there. Walter Johnson, he’s a historian friend of mine, is doing a new book on this longer history of St. Louis leading up to the killing of Mike Brown. But if you look at St. Louis in that context, it was the epicenter of the fur trade, it became the epicenter of the westward military expeditions and campaigns to take care of the Indian problem once and for all through the Indian Wars, and then it became a trade route epicenter for the damming of the river, etc. So it played that important and pivotal role. But I think, going back to the gendered relations, when Europeans first came they left patriarchs when they left oftentimes. And so we’ve internalized much of that heteropatriarchy into our own communities, and it was a tool of domination. The realm of business, the realm of trade, and the realm of diplomacy was relegated to men specifically. And so it created this new dynamic in which Indigenous men then became political spokespeople to outsiders. And it actually inverted a lot of political structures for Indigenous communities. Because even if you just Google Indigenous people such as the Sioux or the Lakota, you’re typically only going to see pictures of the 19th century of Indigenous men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Which is also a gender divide between the domestic and public sphere that’s quite amenable to capitalist social relations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:And I think we’ve internalized that kind of structure as well. What I was trying to do in this particular chapter, called “Origins,” and I was juxtaposing our origin story as Lakota people; the first person to bring us into relations with the non-human world was a woman. And so we tried to honor that original covenant with Pte Ska Win, the White Buffalo Woman, who brought us into correct relations, specifically with the Buffalo nation. That was our first treaty. And the word WoLakota actually means treaty, but it also means to live in peace. And so every treaty that we signed or that we made since then goes back to that original covenant, which was made by a woman. But if we look at the treaties of the 19th century they were all made by men for a specific reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Resistance to the settler colonialist economy was, in large part, made possible when Native people could fall back on subsistence, an alternative economy that allowed for an exit and refusal of capitalist market relations. And so to destroy the possibility of refuge from the settler colonialist market, the U.S. systematically attacked and destroyed that basis for subsistence. And, as you alluded to earlier, in the 1860s the U.S. destroyed 10 to 15 million buffalos in less than two decades, almost eliminating a population that once stood at 25 to 30 million. There was allotment, or the privatization, decollectivization of Native land––in a sense, that denationalization of land. And then, in the 20th century, as you mentioned earlier, the flooding of the Missouri River under huge swaths of reservation land. And you cite the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 1946 Missouri River Basin investigation, which made this all abundantly clear. The report found that Native people depended upon the “free goods of nature” and that dispossessing them of land via flooding would force them “into seeking cash incomes to make up for the substantial portion of income now represented by their use of natural resources of their present environment.” And the head of the BIA at the time, Dillon Myer, a man who had been in charge of Japanese internment during World War II, said that it was “the starting point to more assimilation and integration, away from a narrow and inbred way of life that was customary of reservation living.” What role did the destruction of the possibility of subsistence, time and again, play in this multi-front genocide? And how did Native people resist over time? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The question of food has played an important role, specifically for the Lakota and Dakota people. If we go back to the 1862 U.S.-Dakota War in what was then Minnesota territory, that began when several Dakota men, who were starving because they had their rations cut––it was during the Civil War––went into a white settler’s farm and stole chicken eggs. They ended up killing most of the settler family and then it sparked this larger confrontation. So that war began around food and starvation. There was the Mormon calf incident, where a Mormon overland traveler going west had let a lame calf wander into a camp of Sicangu or Lakota people, who were starving. And they killed the calf because there was no owner around. They didn’t see anybody who was taking care of the calf. And then that Mormon wanted retribution against them, and then sent the military after them. The military was destroyed by us, but–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Over a single calf–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:That was lame, right. And we didn’t see anybody around, and we actually tried to pay the Mormon family with buffalo meat to compensate for the taking of their calf, but they didn’t want it. So in this early contestation, the contestation wasn’t just about a clash of civilizations or a clash of cultures as we’re often told, but it was about how we subsist. How do we physically reproduce ourselves on the land? And so when we signed our treaties with the United States government, that was one of the first things that we talked about. Yes, there were some elements of the reservation communities that wanted to begin adopting more agriculture into their lifestyles, but by and large they wanted to retain hunting rights. And we can see that with the Crow Nation. There was a recent Federal Court case that was decided that decided that the Crow Nation still had access to hunting territory, and it goes back to their 1868 Treaty that they signed with the United States government. Indigenous communities along the river specifically were much different from those who are further away from the water source. But those Indigenous communities that were along the Missouri River had a mixed economy of subsistence. They had large cattle herds that they could make money off of, while at the same time subsisting off of the land itself. And so, with the creation of the Pick-Sloan Dams, in that report that you were reading, 75 percent of the wildlife was destroyed by the dams and 90 percent of commercial timber was also destroyed when they flooded the land. That is something we have not actually physically recovered from as nations on the river itself. There are many wild plants and animals that have never fully returned or have never been fully restored. That’s something that we’re talking about in the context of: how do we create food sovereignty? We do manage buffalo herds, even though they were nearly extinct because of the mass slaughter in buffalo genocide. But we are managing our own buffalo herds, and we are managing our own Indigenous lands. And we’re trying to recuperate what would be called a “subsistence economy” because we are entirely dependent, not just on rations and commodities as we call them, but we’re entirely dependent on the cash economy. And so, in many ways, the creation of the Pick-Sloan Dams coalesced with termination and federal relocation policies at the time. And if you read those reports, these Bureau of Indian Affairs anthropologists and policymakers and Dillon S. Myer, who you just quoted, were seeing these dams as a physical means to implement termination. Because one, it flooded a lot of reservation headquarters. It flooded the Lower Brule headquarters. It flooded the headquarters for the Crow Creek reservation. It flooded Yankton’s headquarters. It flooded Cheyenne River’s headquarters. Luckily, most of Standing Rock’s headquarters were safe, but up in Fort Berthold, those headquarters were destroyed as well. And so the plan was: well, since we’ve taken the central location of these Indigenous nations away from them, now they’re going to have to relocate those services off the reservation. That will be part of this relocation plan to move Indigenous people off the land and move them into surrounding border towns. And, in the case of our nation, it was Chamberlain, where I was born and raised. In Chamberlain, this is the paradox of relocation and this is the paradox of Israeli settler colonialism too. They want Indigenous land. They want Palestinian land. But they don’t want Indigenous people and they don’t want Palestinians. And so, the failure of the termination project and the failure of the relocation project was the pure bigotry of South Dakota saying, “We don’t really want to fully integrate these people into our public school system, into our welfare system, we don’t want to take on that burden, and we want the land but we don’t want Indigenous people.” There are a lot of things to say about that. But one thing, to go back to this idea of subsistence, is that if we look in our territory as the Oceti Sakowin and look at the Great Sioux reservation, which is the western half of South Dakota, and we talk about, “Well what are we going to do? What does a decolonial future look like?” And oftentimes there’s this question around land: who owns it, what are they doing with it, who profits from it. And if we look at somebody like Ted Turner, he owns 200,000 acres of our treaty land. That acreage is actually larger than our nation as the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. It’s larger than a lot of our smaller Indigenous nations. And so when we talk about decolonization, when we talk about land restoration, yes we are talking about what the Army Corps of Engineers has taken as our shoreline, but we’re also talking about––we’re not talking about kicking people out of their homes, these settler families that have historically lived within our territories, but it’s about changing that relationship to land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:A revealing irony is that the supposed inviability of private property rights––private land rights––didn’t and doesn’t protect ordinary settlers from corporate power. Energy companies and the like have always exercised a higher form of property rights. And so, ordinary white settlers were promised this dream of white egalitarianism, but what was actually taking place, in many ways, beneath the mystifications of racial capitalism, was the concentration of land and wealth in the hands of the few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Absolutely. Land is wealth in this country, especially in a settler colonial nation. And we can talk about the emancipation of human beings as forms of property. And there’s a whole racialization aspect that goes around that, but Native people, and even black people, are racialized according to land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:How did these different relationships to the land inform Indigenous and settler identities and, as you just mentioned, other sorts of identities? On the one hand, the system has fundamentally been about relationships the land, in terms of facilitating the settler colonial order of domination, it’s racialized hierarchies, and the raw materiality of acquiring its land base. But at the same time, this ideology of civilizational differences often was exposed as a thin pretext for the material interests at play. If you look at the so-called “Five Civilized Tribes” in the southeast, like the Cherokee, who became sedentary farmers and ran cotton plantations that used enslaved labor. They were still moved, and violently. What does that reveal about the relationship between the land ideology of settler colonialism and its material reality?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:So the context of the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeastern United States to the West is really important. That also was about westward expansion. It was about securing, primarily, access to gold mines in places like Georgia, but it was also about the seizure of property. When Jackson, and then Van Buren, removed the Five Civilized Tribes from the southeastern part of the United States, settlers literally just moved into these communities and took over these plantations. Yes, land was central to that project, but the Cherokee Nation is really fascinating too because, at that time, they had their own written newspaper, they had their own tricameral legislature, they had their own separation of powers, they had their own judges, they were sending a lot of their children (of these slaveowning elites) to places like Harvard, they were getting education, they had their own lawyers; for all intents and purposes they were a “civilized nation,” but nonetheless they weren’t citizens of a settler nation. So as much as they in acted forms of “civilization,” they could never fully achieve a settler identity or equality under U.S. federal law. And so that’s what’s really fascinating. And while the foundation of federal Indian law is codified within the Marshall Trilogy, nonetheless those Supreme Court decisions by John Marshall relegate Indigenous peoples almost as outside of settlers citizenship. So Johnson v. M’Intosh is an important Supreme Court decision, and I detail it in the book, because it designates Indigenous nations as “domestic dependent nations.” But what people don’t understand, and why you can’t just read settler colonialism within the legal framework, is that the United States at that time was just a small cluster of colonies hugging the Atlantic seaboard. But yet that law was applied to all Indigenous nations after the fact, even though we had nothing to do with that Supreme Court decision. And so when we think about the question of land and the question of slavery specifically, we can’t talk about settler colonialism without talking about the institution of slavery because Black slavery specifically was the engine of westward expansion, both in an economic sense, but also in a political sense. When we look at westward expansion and the addition of states and territories, there was the question of free state versus slave state. So Texas couldn’t become a state until Oregon Territory had organized into a state. And to organize Oregon Territory into a state you had to annihilate all the Indigenous people there, or at least subdue them. But then also, in Texas, there were Indigenous wars against the Comanche Nation, against a lot of the Plains tribes down there––the Kiowa as well––and even the expulsion and removal of the Kickapoo, who were in the Ohio River Valley, but now are in Mexico because they were fleeing westward expansion. So we can think of westward expansion and the context of slavery as fueling the creep westward. That’s one aspect. But then after the Emancipation Proclamation and the conclusion of the bloody Civil War, we also have the occupation of the South to enforce Reconstruction. Once the northern capitalists lost interest in overseeing Radical Reconstruction in the South, that army was withdrawn. But that army didn’t just disappear; it went westward. And so we have to think about that. And also we can think about Richard Henry Pratt, who was the architect of the Carlisle Industrial Indian School, which became the formula for off-reservation boarding schools and the assimilation project for Indigenous people. He got that idea when he was commanding units of mixed freed black slaves as well as Indian scouts in punitive campaigns led against the Kiowa and Comanche in parts of southern Texas. The first boarding school was in Carlisle Barracks, which is one of the oldest military outposts in the United States. It was thus transferred into an Indian boarding school, where the first people to go there were the Lakota people. Because at that time, in 1879, we were considered the most militant and hostile Indigenous nations to the United States. And so they took our children, the children of leadership––specifically in Rosebud and Pine Ridge––to essentially hold them hostage. That’s not hyperbole. That’s actually the language that they used. And we see that going back to the British colonists in New England capturing Pequot children and holding them hostage as well, for the good behavior of their people. It served as both an assimilative gift of civilization, and also as a coercive measure against their leadership. We can trace the influence of slavery because Richard Henry Pratt, in all his benevolence, didn’t believe in biological racism. He didn’t believe, biologically, that Black people were inferior to white people or Indigenous people were inferior to white people, but he did believe in a kind of social civilization chauvinism. Meaning that what made Black people more susceptible to settler citizenship or incorporation into the United States was the fact that they had experienced natal alienation. They lost their culture, their land base, their families were completely, utterly destroyed. He looked at that as a positive model for Indigenous people, to say, “We need to take them from their families, isolate them from their nations, and that’s the only way they can successfully become productive citizens of the United States.” It really boils down to the land and the sense that they were taking these children, not because they wanted to give us civilization––most of the children that went to these boarding schools never graduated. So, what was the purpose? The purpose was to force our leadership to sign over land. And when it came down to 1887, when we resisted allotment for the first time in 1889, we signed what was called the Great Sioux Agreement, which opened up nine million acres of our land, and created what we now know as the modern reservations in West River South Dakota. All of these policies were about the land and acquiring the land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You make an interesting distinction between two different settler orientations to Indigenous land. On the one hand, the land has been targeted because it’s valuable, for farming or for gold in the Black Hills. But then, with the flooding of the Missouri, you write, “Our lands and lives were targeted not because they held precious resources or labor to be extracted. In fact, the opposite was true. Our lands and lives were targeted and held value because they could be wasted, submerged, destroyed.” Explain your argument and what this reveals about settler colonialism and capitalism, this dynamic of seizing land either for profit or for waste, in the pursuit of profit elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Richard Nixon created this term, “national sacrifice zone,” when he was talking about uranium mining in the West. To fuel U.S. economic and military interests we had to sacrifice these areas in the West, what a lot of people call “flyover country.” And we can think about that in the context of a lot of different U.S. presidents. Teddy Roosevelt created the modern national park system. And to do so, ideologically, he had to put Native people out of existence. The fact that in Yellowstone National Park there were Shoshone people still living there on the land, but if we look at a lot of the photography of Ansel Adams, or the Western landscape portraits, or the Western landscape art, it often depicts an empty barren land. Land so plentiful. And if we look at our passports as U.S. citizens and we look at the artwork in there, it’s typically about our national monuments and many of them are natural landscapes. And so this plays a very important ideological function. It does a lot of political work. It describes the West as this open landscape, free of Indigenous people, free of any kind of people. And so if there’s nobody living on the land, or if it’s not being used, then it could be settled. It could be reserved for white tourists to go visit. Or it could be wasted. And so there are all these functions that play an important role in how we understand the West. And so when we talk about this particular aspect of the Pick-Sloan Dams, they weren’t building dams downriver of major white settlements. They had strategically located each of these dams on Indian reservations. And if we go back to the history before the Pick-Sloan Dams when the states themselves––the Missouri River Basin States Authority––created maps. And on those maps they showed the boundaries of the states themselves, but what they didn’t show was the Indian reservations where they were going to build these dams. And so, in many ways, it was already predetermined, before the Flood Control Act of 1944 was passed by Congress, that these dams would be built on Indian reservations. Dams are very destructive and if we look at dams throughout the world and dams that are being built in places like China and India, they’re not building dams next to major metropolitan areas. They’re building dams in rural spaces, where they often think you know life is cheaper, life can be easily relocated, and there isn’t much use of the land. And that’s also been an important aspect of the  racialization of Native people. That we’re “nomadic,” thus our removal is made much easier. And I want to push back on some notions here about Lakota people specifically. Yes, we did follow the buffalo herds. Yes, we we were, for all intents and purposes, people who traveled quite frequently. But yet, if we look at the names that we called ourselves, like Miniconjou, which means “plants by the water”, it suggests that we have a different relationship to the land and we weren’t just aimlessly roaming across the plains. “Plants by the water,” Miniconjou, those people typically lived by the river and set up seasonal camps where they grew corn. And if you know anything about corn, corn requires a lot of intensive care. It requires human intervention. It can’t grow wild. There are a lot of plants and vegetables that we did harvest from the wild, but there were a lot of domesticated plants that we use such as corn, beans, and squash. And so when we look at that transition to the reservation period, to a more sedentary life––I don’t want to glorify it; the reservation period was horrific. A lot of people starved, a lot of people died, but nonetheless, the transition to a sedentary life was much easier because we had that agricultural knowledge. And if we go back to that original agreement that we made with Pte Ska Win and the White Buffalo Calf Woman––yes, we were brought into relation with all of these animal nations, but on that pictograph that I show, that winter count, which is one of the earliest pictographs, there was also a corn stock. And she is depicted as a white buffalo within the center of a camp circle. Out of her udders are corn kernels flowing into a water. And so there is a relationship to agriculture, and 80 percent of Indigenous nations in the Western Hemisphere, prior to the arrival of Europeans, had some form of agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And yet this myth of total nomadism was so key to justifying Indigenous dispossession. The M’Intosh decision, the 1823 Supreme Court decision authored by the famous Chief Justice John Marshall, uses this kind of logic to basically declare the legitimacy of U.S. dispossession by virtue of “conquerors rights.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Even today, modern Indian water law is based on those precepts of civilization, of agriculture. So when a state decides that it wants to assert water rights over a river, oftentimes they’ll take this to court. And it’s adjudicated and it’s called quantification. And what quantification means for Indigenous people is how we use our water. What only counts, under federal Indian water law, is water use for “the purposes of civilization,” because that’s why we signed treaties and that’s why we were put on reservations according to the federal government, is to become civilized Indians. And what form of civilization was that? It was agriculture. So it’s really important to remember that it’s not just some kind of benign racist thing, but it’s actually codified in the law and actually determines how much sovereignty we have over our own natural resources, such as water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And this is an echo of Chief Justice Marshall writing that Natives were “fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country was to leave the country a wilderness.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:And he was drawing from the papal bulls and what is now understood as the “doctrine of discovery.” So when Columbus––who, to his dying day believed that he landed in India not the Americas––when he was authorized by the Spanish crown to conquer or to claim this land and its people in the name of that crown, he was authorized to do so by the Vatican. And they created these edicts, such as the papal bulls. You can read them; they’re online. But these became the basis for, not just federal Indian law, but also international law. And so there’s the debates of Vitoria that were happening in the mid-1500s about whether or not Indigenous people were humans. Ultimately, they decided that we were partially human. So the Spanish had to convert us, or at least offer conversion, before they killed us. Nonetheless, this has been codified within federal Indian law in the United States. And so, in the chapter that you’re quoting, that quote from John Marshall, who is being quoted by Judge Erbaum in a federal court decision about whether or not the United States has jurisdiction in Sioux Territory–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:In 1974. A rather recent case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE: Exactly, and even the most recent case that was decided with the Crow Tribe, the law that they’re citing is based on these papal bulls that were passed in the end of the 15th century and into the 16th century. So these are old very problematic and flawed conceptions of Indigenous people, very dehumanizing in many ways. But this is the basis of federal Indian law. It’s very conservative. And it’s not conservative in the political sense, but it’s conservative in the sense that it draws upon these backward notions of Indigenous people. And so, when a lot of our political issues get tied up in the courts, this is the basis that federal judges are required to draw from, this precedent of Indian law. And it often works against us. Sometimes it works in our favor, but oftentimes it works against us. And until it’s repealed at a federal level we’re still going to be encountering the papal bulls of the 15th century. And as far as I know the Vatican, for all of its problems, doesn’t accept these as valid today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:When the Vatican is more progressive than a supposedly secular democratic state’s legal system, you know you have a really big problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to pause here to discuss the centrality of treaties in Native politics, particularly the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty in the case of the Oceti Sakowin. What did and do treaties mean to the settler government? And what did and do they mean to Native nations? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:I’ll answer the second part of that question first. The United States has had a monopoly of interpretation of the treaties it signed with us. But a treaty has to be equally interpreted by all parties. Our treaties have been imbricated into federal court systems, imbricated into congressional law, but our interpretation of those treaties is that this is our original agreement with the United States government. And so the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty is very foundational in who we are as Indigenous people, as Lakota people specifically, and Dakota and Nakota people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And it’s signed after a rather successful round of armed resistance on the part of Native peoples. When a group under Crazy Horse’s leadership destroys an entire unit of troops, the U.S. is forced to come to the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:That was what they what they called Red Cloud’s War. Red Cloud was one of the main treaty signers. He was one of the main treaty negotiators. And there was a question, there was an internal debate amongst our nations, as to what to do about the United States government. We understood that the United States was militarily, economically, and politically weakened by the Civil War. And there was a debate about whether or not we should actually wipe out most of the white settlements in our homelands and to wipe out all of the forts. We did wipe out a lot of the forts in the western frontier of our territory because they were interfering with our access to the buffalo herds, but we chose the path of diplomacy. And I think that speaks volumes. We had an upper hand in that region, not across North America in general, but in that region we had an upper hand. Militarily we couldn’t be defeated. And so we drew the U.S. to the negotiating table. And there are a lot of debates about whether or not we fully understood what was being presented to us, because we couldn’t read what was on the paper. But we have our own oral traditions, and oftentimes you’ll go to cultural events around our nation (on the reservations, powwows, gatherings political gatherings etc.) and they will talk about the treaties and there’s such an in-depth knowledge of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty that it’s cited verbatim from memory, about what is in that treaty and what was promised to us. And so in the context of Red Cloud, he understood, for example, the hunting territory of our nation, which was about 30 to 35 million acres, as something that was reserved specifically for the Buffalo Nation. And so, in that way, we were signing that treaty on behalf of a non-human nation to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And these are expansive hunting grounds in the Powder River Basin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The Powder River Basin, going up to the Hart River and the area between what is now Standing Rock and Mandan, North Dakota, which was currently a contested construction route for the Dakota Access Pipeline. So this hunting territory plays an important role because it says, “So long as the buffalo shall roam to justify the chase,” or something along those lines. And why that’s an important clause of the treaty is because if there are no buffalo, then there’s no hunting territory. And initially some of the treaty negotiators were hesitant to put that in there because it was such a concession to allow this expansive territory. How are we going to rein in the militant bands that decide not to live on reservations? And the answer to that was, “Well, we kill the buffalo.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:It seems like one question might be not whether Native people understood the treaty they were signing because they couldn’t read the text, but just whether they could imagine that the U.S. government would read that clause in such a twisted way to do something that was probably literally unimaginable: the apocalyptic destruction of the buffalo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:It’s something that I’ve pondered over and I wish, I mean I could write a whole book on just that, and our oral interpretations of that treaty and of that clause. And if you look at even Red Cloud’s testimony when he resigned as the leader of the Pine Ridge Agency, he cites that clause specifically. And he says something along the lines of “The Lakota need the buffalo and the buffalo need the Lakotas and without our hunting territory, we are no longer Lakota people.” So he understood––I’m not trying to paint Red Cloud as a tragic figure, but there was a huge amount of loss, not just on the human side, but on the non-human side as well in that particular moment in time. And I think it leads up to even––and this is a different conversation––the reason why something like the Ghost Dance caught on, because it wasn’t just about the return of Indigenous life, but it was about the return of non-human life. And if you look at the Ghost Dance songs, there were songs for the buffalo and the return of the buffalo. There were songs for the return of the bear, the plains bear that had been almost utterly annihilated. And if you just look at our last names of the people who still have those really old traditional last names they are names like Bull Bear, they are names like Spotted Tail, Black Elk. They are names that suggest that we had a relationship, a profound relationship, to these non-human relatives. That goes back to how we understood this treaty. And so when we’re advocating for the restoration of our treaty lands, we also are advocating for the restoration of our treaty relatives so to speak, those other nations, those non-human nations who signed that treaty. And so if we look at the current state of things, buffalo herds require an expansive territory and this is a whole other question that we’re talking about on reservation communities, is that our reservations are so fractionated and so fenced off and so small that we can’t really facilitate the mass reintroduction of buffalo herds unless we take out fences and we open up a “common pasture” so to speak, where buffalo can range. To go back to the treaty though, and the interpretation that the United States government has had, we’ve signed (as the Lakota, Dakota, Nakota people) about 35 treaties with the United States. The first was in 1885 and the last was in 1868. Three years later, of course, they abolished treaty-making. Most of these treaties, if you go back and read them, the first thing that they establish is that the United States is the sole sovereign in the region, and it’s to acknowledge that we will only negotiate with the United States. So the first treaties were essentially to box out the other European powers (the French and the British and even the Spanish) in that region and that we would only negotiate with the United States. Later on, the 1851 Treaty at Fort Laramie brought together tens of thousands of Indigenous people on the plains. And it was what the U.S. government described as a brokered peace among warring factions, and that if an issue arose over hunting competition, over hunting grounds, that the United States would be the one who negotiated or mediated that conflict, establishing the U.S. government as the protectorate of these Indigenous nations. And the 1868 Treaty is really fascinating because it was more expansive in many ways of Indigenous rights, specifically for the Lakota people in what our territory actually was and the kind of resources that we would get from the government, but also the protections. For example, in that treaty, it maps out or delineates the western half of what is now South Dakota as the permanent home of the Sioux Nation of Indians. We signed that before South Dakota became a state. And so the contestation right now, as we see with Governor Kristi Noem, is that she wants to criminalize Indigenous protests to what are called “critical infrastructure” in our own homelands in the western half of the state of South Dakota. Why somebody like Julian Bear Runner, the president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, banished her is, he cites, and most people don’t read too much into this, the tribal council cites the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty and says that that territory which the Keystone XL Pipeline is currently projected to pass through is territory that was never legally granted to the U.S. government, so the state of South Dakota has no authority over that and that we don’t recognize the supreme sovereignty of South Dakota because we’ve never signed an agreement with them. And it is legal to banish the governor of a state from Indigenous lands, and they are citing specifically the authority granted under the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Explain how that era of mass armed resistance in the 19th century came to an end, and how it led to a shift in the dominant mode of settler colonialist domination: from military repression to a system of carceral control that created the modern reservations, a system defined by reservation police, boarding schools, missionaries, altogether aimed at breaking cultural, political, and kinship institutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The transition from armed resistance to one of reservation life was a very traumatic one. For us specifically it’s marked by the 1876 Battle of Greasy Grass, when we wiped out the 7th Calvary–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Custer’s so-called “Last Stand.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Yeah, Custer’s so-called “Last Stand.” It was the centennial celebration of the United States’ birthday and the Declaration of Independence. And I feel like there was a big win that Custer wanted to make before the centennial celebration on July 4th, which was almost a week before he was killed at the “Battle of Little Bighorn,” as the U.S. government calls it. At this time period it wasn’t just militant bands of the Lakotas who were still waging armed resistance. A lot of reservation-based people would slip away from the reservation system and join them to live like free Lakota people, and to hunt, and follow the buffalo, and to live under the leadership of people who had never signed treaties with the United States government. After the Battle of Little Bighorn at Greasy Grass there was an understanding that we had done something that was going to reap a lot of consequences for our people. And so the bands scattered. And some of them went north to Canada to seek protection under the British Crown there, such as Sitting Bull, and Crazy Horse was there for a while. Others went back to the reservation life, but we weren’t defeated afterwards and then decided militant armed resistance was no longer viable. It was because we actually realized that we couldn’t fight anymore in the sense that the U.S. military, yes, they couldn’t defeat us, but they could take away our food source, and they could take away our children, and they could take away that all the things that we held sacred to our our communities and our families. And so the surrendering was a military surrender in many ways, but it didn’t happen after a major defeat. And I think that’s really important because afterwards––and I don’t really get into this in the book, but it’s something that I encourage a lot of people to read. There’s this book calledby Mario Gonzalez and Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, where they talk about the killing of our pony herds. So they wiped them out because they understood the pony as a tool for mobilization, so we could leave the reservation. We could escape. We could continue to hunt. They wiped out the pony herds. They implemented the reservation pass system, which essentially barred us from leaving the agency to visit another agency without the permission of the Indian agent at the time. And a lot of these Indian agents, they weren’t just technocrats or bureaucrats put out here. A lot of them had investments in the fur trade a lot of them had investments in the killing of buffalo. Some of them even had stakes in mines in the Black Hills. Some of even the Catholic priests that were out there had stakes in mines in the Black Hills. So they were financially benefiting. They call it the Indian Ring on these reservations. They were financially benefiting from these things. But at the same time, you had the implementation of the “Civilization Regulations,” which essentially disallowed dancing, ceremonial feasts, large public gatherings, and giveaways, and also the Sun Dance, which was one of our most sacred ceremonies and most powerful ceremonies. It brought together––we used to just have one big Sun Dance as an entire nation. Now we just have basketball tournaments where everybody gets together. But it was barring these cultural events because it was where we organized politically. And so the transition from armed resistance to the carceral reservation system was a very violent one. It entailed the destruction of our pony herds. It entailed the turning in of our rifles. And oftentimes it wasn’t just rifles for killing human beings, but it was rifles for hunting. And it made us dependent on the reservation system itself. And so, not only was it physically coercive to leave the reservation, but it was almost impossible to, because we had to get our food sources from the rations that were being handed out there. And so the Civilization Regulations are incredibly important because they were implemented around 1885 and they were only repealed in 1935 with the Indian Reorganization Act. But they also helped facilitate the taking of children and putting them into boarding schools, the banning and the outlawing of our language and our religious practices, which weren’t fully “legalized” until 1978. So these are really important. This is a really important and traumatic time for us. But also it still, to this day, on our CDIBs (our certificate of degree of Indian blood cards) that we’re granted by the U.S. Government, the first four numbers are our prisoner of war camp that we were assigned to on that card. So mine is like U-3456, which is––I don’t know if that’s the correct number––but it’s the assignment of the prisoner of war camp for the Lower Brule Sioux tribe. And so each of these tribes, we had a number on our cards. So each of these tribes were assigned a specific prisoner of war camp number, and that’s how people became enrolled as “citizens,” what we now know as citizens of tribal nations. But they were also enrolled according to allotment. So my “U” number, or my “U” letter on my card, means that I’m unallocated. I don’t have Indigenous land on the reservation. And other people are A allottees, who benefit––are descendants of people who were allotted land through the allotment system. So to this day we live with that carceral system. It’s embedded in who we are as tribal citizens of our own nations, but it’s also embedded in our relations to the land base that we come from. And so the reservation period hasn’t ended. Even though we’re allowed to leave the reservation today, many of those punitive policies––allotments stopped in 1935, but many of those punitive policies still exist to this day. At least the afterlives of them exist today. And so I think about the amount of legal and political justification for the reservation system that went into creating these laws, and they haven’t been entirely undone. Indian child removal is still an issue. ICWA is now being challenged in the federal court system by the Goldwater Institute, based out of Arizona, which is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty––to say, essentially, that tribes are not political or legal entities, but they are racial entities, that under civil rights legislation we shouldn’t have a leg up on other people, in the sense that if children are adopted out to white families, tribes shouldn’t have a say because they should be adopted out under equal access to different foster parents and different families. And it doesn’t see us as citizens of a nation. You wouldn’t take, well the U.S. government does this anyway, I was going to say you wouldn’t take a citizen, a child from Mexico, and imprison them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:But that’s just what happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Yeah, that’s just what happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to talk about the other side of this legacy, the legacy of resistance. And you alluded to this earlier. The first big moment of resistance, after the end of mass armed struggle in the 1880s, was the Ghost Dance. And it prophesied that a messiah would destroy the colonial world and reinstate the Indigenous one. And really critical here, you write, is that boarding-school-educated students, people with a foot in both worlds, were key to its spread. What was the Ghost Dance? What conditions led to its emergence? Why did the U.S. see it as such a threat that they ended it by massacring Ghost Dancers at Wounded Knee and by killing Sitting Bull? And looking back, what is its place in this longer trajectory of Indigenous resistance and life? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:So Paiute Prophet Wovoka was the first to envision the Ghost Dance. There are many stories––I’m not an expert on Paiute history––but there are many stories about him as a person and how he came to these visions. I would take a materialist approach to history and say that many of his visions arose from the material conditions that he lived in and that his people lived in during the reservation period. And so, in many ways, they were a response to the conditions of reservations. And if we look historically, and we look at these kind of prophet-inspired or prophecy-inspired movements for Indigenous peoples, we can look at Tenskwatawa and the Ohio River Valley and the creation of Prophetstown. And his brother, who we all know, Tecumseh, brought together disparate Indigenous nations into a kind of political confederacy to push back westward expansion of the United States into the Ohio River Valley. But Tenskwatawa’s vision and prophecy was very much a response to the specific social conditions at that particular time. And so, yes, there is this kind of esoteric spiritual element to it, but I think it’s more important to look at those material conditions that led to these uprisings and why they’re important. So the Ghost Dance was just another iteration of a prophecy-inspired movement. I wouldn’t say Wovoka was a leader of it, but he was an instigator of envisioning an Indigenous future, one in which the colonial relation was abolished and had ended, that Indigenous people would go back to living the way they were, or at least return to a more just and equal realm. And the funny thing about it, and most people don’t talk about this, is that there were non-Indigenous people who participated in the Ghost Dance as well, specifically in Ute and Paiute territory. The way it proliferated for Lakota people––Lakota leaders traveled to Pyramid Lake, Nevada where Wovoka was living. And they travelled by train, and they actually got permission by the Indian agent and passes to travel by train too. This is a thoroughly modern affair. You know, they weren’t riding by horseback through the desert on “A Horse With No Name.” They were riding the train in a modern transportation system. And so they went to visit Wovoka. And they saw the prophecy, and he instructed them how to perform the dance, and the reason why they need to perform the dance. And so when they took it back to the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Agencies, there were boarding-school-educated Lakota people who were there who transcribed the prophecy both in Lakota and in English. And they sent out these letters, and this is in James Mooney’s own investigation of the Ghost Dance. James Mooney was an ethnographer, an agent of empire hired by the United States to investigate the root causes of the Ghost Dance. In his book, his interpretation of the Ghost Dance has now become the standard bearer interpretation of the Ghost Dance Movement itself. And its problems lie within James Mooney himself, as an agent of empire. He was a lawyer who was kind of an armchair ethnographer, as many ethnographers and anthropologists were at the time. So he traveled out West and collected oral interviews. He visited multiple Indigenous nations and, of course, most of his focus was on the Lakota and Dakota interpretations of the Ghost Dance, which he says we misinterpreted. But going back to these boarding-school-educated Lakota children and young people, they were very much an integral aspect of this movement and its spread to different Indigenous reservations, specifically among the Lakota and Dakota people. And so in that sense it was a thoroughly modern anti-colonial resistance movement. It wasn’t what James Mooney saw as a millenarian religious revitalization movement that believed in an apocalypse. It was using the conditions in which Indigenous people found themselves, which were reservation conditions, and the tools that were introduced, such as writing and speaking in English, to spread its message. And to me, when I was reading that, I was like, our interpretation of the Ghost Dance is fundamentally wrong because the Ghost Dance often appears in U.S. history books, much like Indigenous people, to die tragically at Wounded Knee in 1890. And so during this time on the reservations, even on the reservations that had leadership that was more amenable to the United States, people were Ghost Dancing in the sense that they were withdrawing and refusing to participate in the reservation economies and reservation political life. They were no longer asking permission from the Indian agent to do things, to hold dances. Dancing itself was illegal, so just the very nature of the Ghost Dance was illegal because we weren’t allowed to dance. And so they would often withdraw from the agency towns and go out into these remote parts of the reservation and hold these dances, often in secret, most often in public. Were they armed? Absolutely. This was a very violent time. The Indian policy at the time had created what was called the “Indian police” to essentially enforce the reservation order, to prevent people from dancing, to prevent people from leaving the reservation. And what made this particularly nefarious was that this split up families, because a child would get recruited––a boarding-school-educated child would get recruited to the Indian police––and then be required to arrest his grandmother or his grandfather for participating in a ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And this is not so long after the final moments of mass armed conflict and armed resistance. Custer was being sent in to enforce a federal decree that Native people either had to immediately return to their reservations or be considered hostile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:That’s what was happening on the reservation. We also have to consider that 1889 was the year that North Dakota and South Dakota achieved statehood. And, as part of their Enabling Acts, and most Enabling Acts of Western states––actually, I think almost all states that were allowed into the Union as part of their Enabling Act to be recognized as a state––have to forgo interfering with Indigenous people in Indigenous nations to maintain that federal relationship, or that worship status with the federal government. And so South Dakota, to establish statehood, understood that the western half of its territory was carved up by large land-based tribes and it wanted access to that territory. So as much as the repression of the Ghost Dance was initiated at the federal level, the rallying against Ghost Dancers really began at the local level with these white settlers. Places like Rapid City organized what was called “The Cowboy Militia,” which was an armed vigilante group that would go around and kill Native people. They massacred 75 Native people who had left the reservation. So this was all leading up to the Wounded Knee massacre in the state of South Dakota. And there was what was called the “land boom” in South Dakota upon its achieving statehood, where you had white settlers who were essentially squatting on Indigenous land and near reservations. And there are a lot of towns in the western half of South Dakota where you ask some of these old landowners if they can produce the original title to the land and they can’t. So they’re eating away at this reservation territory. And a lot of people at this time weren’t getting their rations on time, so they were going out and killing settlers’ cattle to eat and to prevent starvation. So this was the context. It was a very intense moment. And so, at the local level, you had white settlers who were petitioning state governments to do something and state governments thus going on and petitioning the federal government to do something. So they created a mass scare, very similar to what happened at Standing Rock. So you had the armament of these settler militias, such as the Cowboy Militia that was created in Rapid City, and they’re like, “If you don’t do something, we’re gonna do something.” And so the federal government deployed half of its standing army against starving, horseless, and unarmed people. A lot of these Ghost Dancers, were they are armed? Yes, but they weren’t armed in the sense to take over and have an armed revolution. They were protesting in the best way they knew how against the conditions that they were facing on the reservation. But yet they represented a political threat to the order of things, and the idea that if these Indians don’t come under control, it could potentially lead to armed conflict with these white settlers that are surrounding the reservations. So half the standing army was deployed. Spotted Elk, who is also known as Si Tanka or Bigfoot, fled from the Cheyenne River and camped with Sitting Bull in December at that time. And he had led a group of Ghost Dancers, which was primarily women, children, and elders. There were a handful of men, but there definitely wasn’t a “war party” as it was called later on by the military that was deployed against them. They went to Standing Rock. They actually were staying near Sitting Bull’s encampment. Sitting Bull was aroused one morning by Indian police who essentially assassinated him in his own house, in front of his children. There was a scuffle. Some Indian police got killed and some of Sitting Bull’s followers got killed. Si Tanka, or Bigfoot, was spooked by this entire event and he left the reservation really quickly and didn’t bring a lot of provisions. It was cold during that time and he himself had developed pneumonia, and so he was being carried by a horse drawn wagon. And they fled to Red Cloud’s agency, and they were actually invited by Red Cloud to seek sanctuary in his agency. And they travelled southwards to the Red Cloud agency. They were stopped at a place called Wounded Knee Creek, where they set up camp. There was a lot of confusion about why they were there because it hadn’t been communicated to a lot of the military folks that were there and Custer’s regiment, the 7th Calvary, was deployed at that particular encampment to essentially guard them, put them under armed guard. There are a lot of questions about what happened that morning. And one of the interesting facts of that day was that the day of the massacre was actually 60 degrees, and so it was a very warm day. And the calvary came down and essentially asked Bigfoot’s people to turn over their weapons, their hatchets, and to surrender themselves. And there’s confusion about what happened and who fired the first shot. And I think the widely accepted version is that Smoke, a man who is deaf, had his hunting rifle and he refused to give it over to the soldiers and the two soldiers were trying to confiscate it. And for Lakota people, for warriors, for people who are part of that kind of warrior tradition, they don’t own anything except for their weapons. And so to take a man’s weapon, even if he didn’t use it to kill other human beings, and even if it was just used for hunting, was to take away everything of that person, of that man. So he refused to give it over. He only spoke in signs. It wasn’t communicated to him that that was happening and his gun went off. And thus began the massacre of around 300 Lakota, primarily Miniconjou, people at Wounded Knee. To this day the military recognizes this as a battle, and there’s actually a battle banner of Wounded Knee that the military still flies. The 7th Cavalry still has the battle banner. Eighteen of those soldiers were granted Medals of Honor to recognize it as a legitimate engagement against an armed group of people. But the interesting thing about this, and I document this in the book, is that it didn’t end there. And a lot of the Ghost Dancers, the Oglala Ghost Dancers and Red Cloud’s agency, fled to a place called the stronghold in the Badlands. People like Plenty Horses, Crow Dog, who is also a former Indian police, and Rosebud, who left the Indian police, frustrated with reservation life, went back to being a Lakota person and only spoke Lakota, wore his hair long, and he joined the Ghost Dance resistance. And then it became a much more armed resistance. And there were some churches burned down. There were some settlers who fled because their cattle were killed. But by and large, a lot of the leadership didn’t want any more bloodshed after all of these people had been killed. But in the stronghold, Lieutenant Edward Casey was actually sent out to bring in this hostile group of Ghost Dancers. And Plenty Horses, who had been educated and taken away from his family and sent to Carlisle Indian School, had returned back to the reservation to find that everything that he learned there was incredibly useless on the reservation. There were no jobs. He learned to be a blacksmith, but he couldn’t practice blacksmithing because there were no blacksmiths. There was no shop for him to work. And actually the cutting of his hair caused great humiliation, and the dressing as a white man caused great humiliation and alienation from his own family. And so he had joined this resistance movement in the stronghold. And so when Lieutenant Edward Casey came to meet with the Ghost Dancers, in an act of defiance, Plenty Horses approached him from behind when he was mounted on his horse and shot him in the back of the head and killed him. And of course Plenty Horses was arrested. But the interesting thing about this, and this goes into the narrative that this was a military engagement with an armed group of hostiles, was that when he was put on trial for the murder of Edward Casey, the court had concluded that a state of war had existed. And thus he couldn’t be charged with murdering Edward Casey, because otherwise the Wounded Knee Massacre would have been an act of murder as well. And so the legacy of the Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee is very important for Lakota people. And it actually is a strong marker for us as a transition, not just from the reservation period, but to this decline and political repression of our leadership, of our reservation leadership. You have the formation of the first Treaty Councils that kind of went underground. You have the societies––the cultural societies and the spiritual societies––that all went underground because they feared that the repression that happened at Wounded Knee would be repeated again. And so it was very traumatic for us in that sense but, nonetheless, the spirit of the Ghost Dance itself lived on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to talk more about the destruction of Indigenous relationships with land and with non-human nature. In Lakota and Dakota cosmology, the buffalo are a nation, the Pte Oyate, and so is the Missouri River, the Mni Sose. You write, “Capitalism is not merely an economic system, but also a social system. And it was here abundantly evident that Indigenous social systems offered a radically different way of relating to other people in the world.” Explain how Oceti Sakowin kinship relationships function, not only between humans of various sorts, but also with other-than-human-entities: land, water, creatures. And explain what sort of lessons this kinship model might hold in this current moment, where we live under a dominant system and ideology that devalues nature as a waste dump, in part by invisibilizing the very real and intimate relationships that do exist between humans and the rest of the earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:To begin to answer that question we have to step outside of the book itself and talk about something that I don’t really highlight or explain explicitly in the book, and that’s the concept of WoLakota. If you look up at the dictionary definition of it in the Lakota language dictionary, it says that WoLakota is the translation for “treaties.” It has taken on that meaning, but WoLakota essentially means, what does it mean to live a good life as a Lakota person? And it’s associated with peace, with harmony, and with good relations. So the introduction of WoLakota as a concept obviously began before paper treaties and began before colonization and European invasion. And it began with Pte Ska Win, which is the White Buffalo Calf Woman. She was our primary prophet and also a woman who brought us into correct relations with the human and non-human world. And essentially she made us Lakota people, as the story goes. There is a longer story to it, but suffice it to say that we have our own written records of this first encounter with this woman who taught us how to live correctly with the human and non-human world. And in the book, I talk about Brown Hat’s winter count. And winner counts are pictographic depictions of monumental events that took place during the four seasons. And they were typically recorded during the winter and then retold during the winter, hence the name winter count. And Brown Hat––what’s really fascinating about his winter count is that he was recording the first diplomatic relation Lakota people had entered into with other-than-humans. The first treaty, in a sense, was made with other-than-humans or the human nations, which included the Elk Nation, the Buffalo Nation, the Wolf Nation, the Animal Nations that lived on our lands, and brought us back into correct relationships with them. And also in this pictograph, there was a picture of water. There’s a constellation associated with the Pte Oyate or The Buffalo Nation. That constellation is actually called tayamni, which actually means her water, and it’s a word for womb. It comes from that, when we were made Lakota people, but it’s also connected with this biological or anthropocentric notion of our relationship to water, in the sense that everyone is born in water. That’s the original pictograph. And the irony of it is that the white anthropologists who collected his winter count never explained what these earlier pictographs had meant, and so it’s only been through interpretations by Lakota oral historians that we now know that this is one of the first documentations of when we became Lakota people as we know it today. And so, fast forward to the 19th century when we began making treaties with the United States. I look at, specifically, the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty. And Article 11 of the Fort Laramie Treaty states something to the effect of, “So long as the buffalo shall roam to justify the chase we shall have this hunting territory.” It was a very expansive hunting territory. It actually nearly doubled our treaty territory from the reservation, which was about 32 million acres to the hunting territory, which is about 35 million acres. That hunting territory is where the Dakota Access Pipeline currently trespasses through. But there was actually a recent court decision in which the Supreme Court decided that the Crow Tribe has rights to hunting territory as defined by their 1868 Treaty that they signed with the United States government. And so there is a basis in law for this hunting territory, and it’s specifically related to our relationship or harvesting of non-humans for our sustenance and to continue as Indigenous people. But if we look at that article in our 1868 Treaty, it spells out a direct relationship, not just to the non-human world (in this case the Buffalo Nation), but it spells out a relationship to the land. If there are no longer buffalo roaming that territory, then we no longer have rights to use it and to hunt in that territory. And so how the United States has interpreted that particular article is, “If there are no buffalo, then there is no hunting grounds, and then there is no hunting territory.” And so, to kill a buffalo literally translated into the taking of land. And even this cultural aspect of that; some of the buffalo hunters that came into the region, they were European aristocracy, and they didn’t just come into our region, they came to all of the West and the Great Plains area. And they were guided by the U.S. military to lead these expeditions, which were often called “war parties” or were called “the slaying of red skins.” That was associated with the taking of scalps off of the mutilated corpses of slain Native people. When they began doing this, they didn’t just stop there; they would take the hides and leave the carcasses to rot and then poison the carcasses with strychnine to get rid of scavengers and the predatory animals such as coyotes and wolves, but then also, in some instances, Native people who were starving. There is this esoteric and there is this spiritual connection to the Buffalo Nation that goes back into our history with Pte Ska Win, the White Buffalo Woman, but also there is a direct material connection to that buffalo, and the legal/ political connection that is codified within the treaties itself. When Red Cloud Maȟpíya Lúta, the leader of the Oglalas, abdicated from his leadership in the Pine Ridge Reservation, he said, “We were told the land of the Lakota was the land of the buffalo. The buffalo shall have their land, so that they shall roam and the Lakota shall have their buffalo.” It wasn’t some kind of mystical ahistorical relationship that he was articulating. He was talking about that Article 11, that it was not just a protection of our hunting territory, but it was a protection of the Buffalo Nation itself. And that extends to the protection of water. When we look at the treaties, not only does it talk about where we’re going to get our food, such as hunting and agriculture, but it also talks about what are our territorial boundaries as defined by water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Could you say more about this explicit naming of these very concrete and material relationships with non-human nature? And what lessons, at the risk of romanticizing Indigenous knowledge, what lessons we might learn, as so much of humanity remains in such intense denial of our relationship to non-human nature that we risk rendering much of the earth uninhabitable? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:So Robert Williams, he’s a Native lawyer and jurist, he’s written extensively on how the legal canon has essentially bifurcated humans from “nature.” And so within the legal canon itself, just as one example, in one institution of Western society, in capitalist society, where that bifurcation functions. He also points out that most Indigenous people, prior to European invasion, had no Cartesian split between human and non-human. For example, as I have just explained, there was no delineation between human nation and non-human nation. They were all nations of people, essentially, that had equal rights in compacts and agreements. And without romanticizing this notion, it’s ingrained in a lot of Indigenous epistemologies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And ironically it’s frankly more materialist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:I would agree with you there. And also, the current U.N. report identifies at least a quarter of the world’s land area as being traditionally owned or occupied or managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities, who have distinct connections––whether they’re cultural, spiritual, political––to their homelands and bioregions. And this includes about 35 percent of global area formerly protected by governments or other entities. And 35 percent of ecosystems that experience limited human intervention. And this is a recent U.N. report. So the best kinds of environmental policy come from the ground up, from these communities. And Indigenous communities hold within their own regions around 70 percent of the world’s biodiversity. And that includes the Indigenous nations, the diminished Indigenous nations, of the United States and Canada. I was thinking about this earlier, about however problematic Engels was in his, he does prove through the use of Lewis Henry Morgan, an anthropologist who studied Indigenous kinship relations, that hetero-nuclear families, capitalism, and colonialism are neither natural nor are they inevitable, because there are or there were actually non-capitalist societies living alongside of capitalist societies. And not all societies tend towards capitalism or the exploitation of nature as we know it today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Right. The breaking up and privatization of the land is critical to the story of settler colonialism that you tell. There was raw genocidal dispossession, there was the treaty system and its rampant violation by the U.S., and there was the confinement of Native people to reservations. And then, on the other end of this process, there was this concerted effort to recruit white settlers, including powerful laws like the 1862 Homestead Act, which transferred a huge amount of land to settlers, and the 1887 Dawes Act, which privatized Native land so that it could be sold to settlers. Explain this history and what it reveals about one, the relationship between settler colonialism and land, and two, between the settler colonialist state and capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:So first of all, just to build off of what we have been talking about, settler colonialism isn’t just an anthropocentric process, meaning that it’s not just about dispossessing or eliminating human people or human nations. It’s also about eliminating Indigenous peoples relations with the land and with other than humans. And whereas other genocides have had a beginning and an end, the current one, against Indigenous people and Indigenous land and relations, has a beginning but no end. And it can be tracked specifically through land policy, as you just pointed out. So, for example, the Homestead Act was a way, as people like Greg Grandin and Richard Slotkin have argued, to create a “pressure valve” to open up the West, to relieve the contradictions that are inherent within the expansion of slavery, and the contradictions of slavery in the South and in the East and to eventually prevent outright class war amongst white settlers themselves. Because even the presidents, such as John Quincy Adams, who said that there’s one thing that all European Americans can unite around, and that’s the killing of Indians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:He said that disapprovingly, to clarify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:He was saying it to criticize westward expansion. But I think folks like Jodi Byrd, in her book,, talks about this sort of paradigmatic Indianness, in which settler colonialism creates the figure of the Indian to be destroyed and to dispossess. And it manifests through the ways in which empire expands, not just within a territorial context, but within an economic context. And that boils down to land, within North America, specifically, and within North American settler colonialism. So the Homestead Act opens up land––very cheap land––for white settlers. And railroad companies are playing a major role in this; they have what are called “colonization offices,” specifically in the Nordic European countries, to recruit poor folks to essentially put them out as cannon fodder on the Western frontier, to occupy these places near railroads or near infrastructure, to create towns, essentially. And then accompanying that, it’s not just the Homestead Act, it’s a series of Homestead Acts. You have the Desert Land Act much later that essentially provides federal subsidies to improve the land and provide irrigation. So you have a lot of public investment into creating value on this land through agriculture, primarily. And agriculture is an interesting form of settler colonialism because it’s considered permanent and it’s considered something that destroys the Indigenous flora and fauna––going back to that idea that elimination isn’t just about eliminating Native people or humans, but it’s also about eliminating Native non-human life as well, including plants and animals. So over time it eats away at these territories, not just in a legal and political sense, but in an agricultural sense. Entire species of plants and animals are being replaced by domesticated agriculture. And we can look today at the effects of that when we look at our homelands. When on the reservation, you’re surrounded by food production; you’re surrounded by a food factory that’s producing corn, soybeans, and beef, but you can’t find a fresh tomato on the reservation. And it’s not these mom and pop American Gothic landowners who are going out in the morning and milking the cows with their bare hands. These are amalgamated land enterprises by large agricultural companies, such as Monsanto and Cargill, who have eaten up and bought these parcels and now have turned them into production, because you need less and less workers because of the mechanization of labor to actually farm all of this land. And so what you have in places in the Great Plains that are more rural is a lot of white flight. And you have a lot of families who are descendants of the original settlers who are leaving, because the idea of this kind of idyllic farming family is no longer economically sustainable. But nonetheless you have them selling something, they’re not just leaving empty-handed, they’re selling land that their ancestors paid bottom dollar for. And so there’s an invested value and there’s an inherited value for a lot of these settler families intergenerationally, so that they can say that they have wealth. And so if we talk about the wealth gap––and we can look at slavery in the sense that there’s this conversation around reparations. When we look at a lot of these early slave plantations and why most European people, when they came here, had so much time to go to school and learn and to become diplomats, is because there were people taking care of their children. There were people who were washing their clothes. There were people who were growing their plants. There were people who were feeding them. And that all went uncompensated, and so there was this accumulation of wealth that was passed on intergenerationally just through stolen labor. And what’s also not really accounted for is the accumulation of wealth through stolen land, and so that’s something that I think we have to take into consideration when we talk about inequality. But when we talk about capitalism, we can look at the ways in which American capitalism, specifically––it requires labor. It requires money. And one of the things that a lot of people on the left always forget, is that it requires land. And land still equals wealth, especially in settler colonial society, and nowhere else in the world are there unique real estate laws and practices as they’ve been developed in places like the United States. And that goes back to settler colonialism and settlement. So when people want to historicize settler colonialism, as saying that it had a beginning and an end, they forget that the land itself is still up for debate and still up for contestation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to talk about another form of violence that was central to the genocide of Indigenous nations. Smallpox, which absolutely devastated nations, killing 80 to 90 percent amongst some. Is there a way to theorize disease, in this case smallpox, politically as a component of settler colonialist genocide beyond the narrow confines of individual human intentionality that the conversation often takes place within? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The communities that were hardest hit by smallpox epidemics had the closest relationships, so to speak, to European traders. So, for example, the Mandan, Arikara, and Hidatsa were sedentary river communities in the Missouri River Basin who had developed strong trade relations with first, the French, and then, the British, and sometimes even the Spanish, and then the United States. And as a result of those relationships, they had increased proximity to disease. And that disease was––I don’t think it helps to say that disease was purposely spread, so much as it was conditioned by the trade itself. And so, for example, when it spread during 1837, in one of the most horrific incidences of smallpox on the Northern Plains, it came up on a steamship where traders had knowingly harbored an individual who was suffering from the symptoms of smallpox. But smallpox is interesting because after one acquires it there may be a three or four day period where they feel absolutely fine. And then later––days later, sometimes a week later––they develop the really intense symptoms, which include fevers and pustules etc. But the period between when it’s contagious and not is hard to determine, and so it was very much exacerbated and intensified because of the fur trade itself. So while we can’t necessarily pin it on an intentional way of spreading disease to decimate populations, we can approximate that it did intensify because of the trade. And it was knowingly spread in certain instances, not to kill off Indigenous people, but to essentially make a profit––so that we wouldn’t have to turn back a trade ship or a steamship just because somebody was infected, but instead to realize one’s profit quota––that’s more important than saving lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You write, “Today’s state violence and surveillance against water protectors is a continuation of the Indian wars of the 19th century.” You write that those Indian wars have also been a model for U.S. empire abroad. Explain this relationship between the history of building the American empire at home and empire abroad, and also perhaps how that history, of Indigenous genocide and dispossession, complicates any neat distinction between home and abroad when we’re talking about American empire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:So if we go back to the practice of treaty making, there was a report that was issued in 1997 by Miguel Alfonso Martínez, who was the special rapporteur on Indigenous peoples at the time. He did a study on treaties, agreements, and other compacts with Indigenous peoples and their colonizing nation state. And one of his conclusions was that treaties are proof of international relationships between Indigenous people and colonizing nation states. And if they are proof of international relationships, what good does it do to reproduce the domestication of Native nations within those colonial states, rather than challenging the domestication process and actually arguing for a kind of international relationship? And I would say, for Indigenous people, specifically in North America, counterinsurgency––the waging of irregular wars against civilian populations––is a form of domestication, is a form of warfare, that looks at Indigenous peoples as an external threat, while also trying to internalize them within the nation state itself. And that plays several functions and it’s unevenly applied across space and time. It differs in different contexts, but nonetheless we can see these similarities. For example, the Pawnee Nation never fought against the United States, but nevertheless suffered almost an 80 percent population decline in the 19th century. And why is that? It wasn’t because of direct military confrontation. It was actually the reservation system itself, and the imposed starvation conditions of the reservation system, that killed off the majority of this population. I would say that that was a form of counterinsurgency. The first boarding schools were created at one of the country’s oldest military barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. It’s no coincidence that the founder of the first boarding school was also an accomplished Indian fighter, as well as a Civil War veteran. The Indian fighters of the late 19th century were Civil War veterans who went on to command troops of mixed freed slaves, alongside Indian scouts, alongside white settlers, against hostile Indian nations in the West. And then, after the so-called “Indian wars” were “won,” those same commanders, those same generals, went on to fight in places like Cuba or, in some cases, in Nicaragua, if they lived long enough. So the overseas imperial project was literally seen as an extension of the Indian wars. And many of these military men, who were veterans of the Civil War and the Indian Wars and then these overseas imperial projects, were very much evidence that this was seen as the logical extension of the frontier. And even though somebody like Frederick Jackson Turner somewhat mythologized the closing of the frontier as the potential closing of a chapter of American history, if we just look at the institution of the United States military, we can see that that chapter was––there was no beginning and end, but it has seamlessly moved on from one war to the next. And if we look at military historians, such as John Grenier, he looks at the first Indian wars as developing the modern tactics of counterinsurgency war that is now taught at West Point in their coin classes. Or even when Indigenous peoples do come up in classes at West Point, it comes up in the question of international law. How do you wage war against people who are not considered human? In the past they were not considered human, but then in the present they’re not considered state actors; non-state enemy combatants such as “terrorists” as we now know in the War on Terror. So there’s a direct lineage that the U.S. military, as an institution, traces back to its first enemies of empire, which were Indigenous peoples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:A related point you make that I want to discuss is this perverse mystification and misrepresentation of reality at the core of settler colonialism. One key way this works is that Native resistance to colonizers is always portrayed as offensive, an invading force. How does settler ideology function within settler colonialism? And what does that tell us about the creation of white settler identity and, more hopefully I guess, how that identity might be unmade? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Invasion is always made to look like self-defense. Whether it’s the United States invading Iraq in 2003, or whether it’s the United States invading Standing Rock, our treaty territory, in 2016, with 96 different law enforcement jurisdictions, it’s made to look like self-defense, and it’s made to criminalize resistance, even in the context of Palestine. When legitimate self-defense is guaranteed to nearly every nation of people under international law, it’s not guaranteed to Indigenous people in North America and it’s not guaranteed to Palestinians in their own territories. And why I bring this up is because we can actually look at the use of chemical weapons, specifically against Indigenous people at Standing Rock or Palestinians. Tear gas is a banned weapon of war. War happens between two sovereigns, but it doesn’t happen between a “domesticated civilian population.” It’s protest against a state. And so, in that context, we can think of John Marshall’s famous phrase “domestic dependent nations.” We are domesticated dependent nations who can be tear gassed. If we were “real nations” it would be against the law to tear gas us. When we think about this idea of self-defense and violence and the settler ideology that mobilizes it, it naturalizes certain territories as expendable and naturalizes certain people as expendable. I don’t know how to necessarily undo that unless we begin to think about settler identity not as something as like, “Oh, it’s my individual identity, this is how I feel about being a settler,” but actually understanding settler identity as being constructed through the law, as being an identity that is actually positioned against Indigenous rights. It’s not something that just exists in somebody’s head. It actually exists in the real world. Turn on your faucet; there’s Indigenous water coming out of it. And so, if we are to begin to answer the question of how do we undo this settler ideology, maybe it’s moving towards something that my friends and I have colloquially called a “settler onticide.” The destruction of a settler ontology, meaning not the destruction of settlers themselves, but the things that grant them settler privileges within the law. Privilege, not like a cultural social privilege, even though that does exist, privilege, if you look at the etymology of it, goes back to legal rights. Why does a settler on Indigenous land, within Indigenous territory, own land? Where did that land come from? This isn’t just a theoretical mind experiment. This is something that’s being discussed amongst Native and settler people themselves, especially back home. For example, there are non-Native farmers, not all of them are white, but non-Native farmers who live within our treaty territories and who are beginning to question their occupancy on our land. And so what does it mean to live in correct relations, not with settler ideology, but in direct relations with the peoples’ lands that you’re living on? Treaties are codified within Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution, which says treaties are the supreme law of the land. That Constitution, whether we like it or not, is everybody’s Constitution. Settlers living on our land are simply upholding the Constitution when they’re upholding our treaty rights to that land, whether it’s access to clean drinking water, our hunting territories, land, education, quality housing etc. Whether guaranteed through treaties for Indigenous people, those are fundamental human rights that are applicable to everybody, but we have to begin thinking about fundamentally that first relation, which is the colonial relation. The seductiveness of the settler identity itself, as we can see in the most extreme forms of fascism arising in the United States or right-wing authoritarianism; the deployment of these tropes of “blood and soil,” the tropes of “This Land Is Our Land,” riffing off of Woody Guthrie’s famous song, which itself has progressive origins, but nonetheless has been taken up as a claim to a collective white nation. It’s incumbent on everybody to really challenge, not just thinking about it as race––racism and the construction of race is very important and it’s very much a part of this process––but fundamentally the primary contradiction, in my mind, is settler colonialism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:A follow-up to that question is just concretely, and there’s no way to answer this in one episode, let alone the answer to one question, but what would a decolonized United States look like? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:I don’t think the United States as we know it today could exist in a decolonized future. That’s the politest way I can say it. There are a lot of movements around ending what they call “settler futurity” and saying that this isn’t something that we should be pushing into the future, it’s something that we should be actively deconstructing if there’s going to be a future, a livable future for everyone at all. I’m not one to speculate on the future, I’m a historian, so I move in the future by looking backwards. And so my back is turned to the future because I think the future is constructed by our past. If we are going to think about a decolonized future, one thing that we can begin to think about in the present is to reframe and reshape how we understand class struggle. In the organizing work that we do, and when we talk about class, and where we teach about class, it often.––to this day, even the most educated and most advanced organizers will still fall into a trope of thinking of class as something that is typically the white male worker. And thinking about how even the casualization of labor and the devaluation of certain workers erases class in certain contexts, where we don’t see it. And to think about the food service industry, which I worked in longer than I’ve been a historian or a scholar; over 10 years in fast food, primarily at Pizza Hut. And Pizza Hut was one of the most diverse places that I’ve ever worked. It was more diverse than the university that I work at right now. And I think that represents the true working class as we know it in the United States, typically people who are folks of color, but also migrant folks as well. And so when we talk about decolonization there tends to be a centering of the settler as the focus of decolonization, and we forget that there are other folks, such as migrant workers, who come to this land whose labor is cheapened just by crossing the border. And they don’t have the same kind of worker’s rights as the typical settler, or even a Native person would have, just by virtue of citizenship. Also, if we look at civil servants, people who work for local, state, federal governments, I like to look at the difference between teachers and cops. Teachers are more than 70 percent women. Cops are about 70-80 percent men. And if we look at their wages, there is a distinct difference in their wages, and cops are often paid more than teachers. And when teachers unionize and strike they’re often criminalized. And there are all these tropes about teachers as wanting too much, but nobody questions police unions. Nobody questions the collective bargaining of police departments, and that’s a whole other story. I don’t believe that the police are the working class at all by any means, but just for the sake of comparison we can look at how just these two roles in our society for public service are gendered. They’re also very racialized, but also teachers are devalued in our society. And to me, and to my mind, and to the work that I do organizing locally, we believe that teachers’ struggles are part of this decolonization movement; they’re potential allies. A lot of Indigenous people themselves are teachers, but also they’re the people who are educating our students on this history. And so, thinking about class struggle expansively as a form of decolonization is incredibly important, not just for the context of North America and the context of settler colonialism, but if we look globally in the 20th century, the most successful class struggles were decolonization movements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You just mentioned immigration, and something I wanted to ask about is, if settler colonialism is fundamentally about the replacement of Indigenous people, Indigenous nations, with settlers, it seems telling that so much xenophobia today is about the fear that the so-called “white race” will be replaced by migrants of color. And then it also seems noteworthy that such a large number of today’s migrants are either mestizos, meaning descendants of European and Indigenous people from Latin America, or Indigenous people from places like Guatemala. This “great replacement” and “white genocide” that the far right is so terrified of, could it actually be viewed from the left and from an Indigenous perspective as something that is not only shaped by colonialism, but that is also itself an act of decolonization given that migration is seemingly making the U.S. more Indigenous? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:There is a demographic fear that the white majority is going to be replaced in this country and that groups such as mine, or scholars such as myself, are actively advocating for the replacement of the white race. And these fears of white genocide are completely fabricated. What it does say, because it does important political work, is it says that settler colonialism is fundamentally a demographic project.  The problems that Israel is facing right now, and why it’s implementing things such as the Jewish nation-state laws, is because it faces a demographic issue. And it sees its challenge as a demographic issue. It has to replace, it has to bolster its population of non-Arabs, primarily European Jewish citizens, to effectively replace Arab Palestinians and Arab people. That includes not just Muslims, but it includes Christians, and Arab Jews themselves. Returning to the context of the United States’ fear of “the great replacement” or the “white genocide.” One, it identifies this demographic challenge that settlers have created for themselves but two, there’s this fear that somehow Native people or Indigenous descendant people who are crossing the border are going to somehow do to settlers what they did to us. It’s like a reconquista. It’s like “turning the tables,” so to speak. And first of all, that’s a very cynical point of view and it only gets you so far. It’s going to run its course, and it’s going to run its course very violently if it’s not stopped. Second of all, it actually creates a caricature of what we’re actually trying to accomplish. It’s not about a demographic or a population replacement. To undo settler colonialism doesn’t mean to essentially be the exact reverse of it and project it backwards. Decolonization also includes white folks as well, as part of that process. Strategically, we’d need non-Natives and strategically, we’ve partnered with non-Natives in our issues, because what affects us also affects other people. This idea of “the great replacement” or “white genocide” is this specter. The sentiment that’s mobilized by Trump, by Border Patrol, is anti-Indigenous. They are targeting specific people who categorically look, or act, or can be perceived as, Indigenous. And so indigeneity, like any kind of racism in general––racism isn’t static––it’s constantly changing. And in the border regions, if one looks Indigenous they won’t say it outright, because Mexicanness is always associated with brownness. But what also gets erased in that is Afro-descendant people as well, and so we need to also be aware of that question as well. But the way that Trump racializes Mexicans, he racializes Central Americans as Indigenous people. And the irony of it is that when it’s reported on in the press it’s typically when a child dies or when a migrant dies, and they’re not identified as Indigenous. And even other Indigenous nations within the United States don’t identify them as Indigenous. So there’s this interesting erasure where the right is deploying indigeneity as a threat, but it’s also being erased in how we’re understanding indigeneity as it functions, especially concerning immigration and migrants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I think xenophobia is anti-Indigenous in a broader sense. It’s anti-Indigenous in the particular sense, in terms of Border Patrol profiling and whatnot, but in this broader sense it reveals what I think is a really too rarely discussed thing that’s at the core of xenophobic ideology in the United States, which is a fear that immigration will undo what the genocide against Native people accomplished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:That actually succinctly identifies the thesis that I kind of beat around the bush on. There’s a reason why at Charlottesville they were chanting, “You will not replace us.” There’s a reason why that sentiment goes hand-in-hand with the explicit anti-Semitism of “Jews will not replace us” as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Switching gears a little, one thing that stuck out to me in your book is that there’s this long-running and powerful tension between, what seemed to me to be, two contradictory settler approaches towards Native people. One approach is to isolate Natives on reservations, and the other was to disperse Native people into white society through a process called “termination.” And it’s remarkable that this was the official name of the policy, “termination,” to move Indigenous people into towns and cities. But meanwhile many white settlers didn’t want Native people in their towns and cities. And police and civilians alike frequently targeted, and continue to target, Native people living off the reservation. How did two such contradictory projects emerge? And how have the tensions between them played out? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:I think that the former emerged first. The idea of isolating or removing people outside of these settled lands was the first project. If we look at Jefferson, Jefferson envisioned the removal of the Cherokee and the so-called “civilized tribes” from the South and West of the Mississippi long before Jackson actually accomplished that feat. It’s always been the project of the original founders to cross that Royal Proclamation Line from 1763. The reason for “independence” was essentially to remove Indigenous people and take their land. The reason why the so-called “Revolutionary War for Independence” was fought was to gain access to Indigenous land while also, of course, expanding the institution of slavery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:To overturn the Proclamation of 1763. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Absolutely. The primary tactic was to essentially remove and isolate Indigenous people into what we now know as reservations. As Indian policy oscillated between isolation or physical extermination into assimilation or what was known in the mid-20th century as “termination,” these tactics worked hand-in-hand. When one didn’t work it would go to the other. Termination, in my estimation and a lot of people’s estimation, had always been a sentiment and always been a goal, but it can never be accomplished as such. And termination has been given different words, nicer words, such as assimilation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Like the founder of the Carlisle Indian School put it. I forget his name, but it was “Kill the Indian, save the man.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The idea was when physical extermination no longer was palatable by an American public, then cultural social extermination became the modus operandi. Termination legislation arose in response to the New Deal legislation, saying, “We need to rein it in with the expansion of tribal sovereignty during the Indian Reorganization Act. We need to rein it in with the expansion of governmental powers to tribal councils. And, in fact, what this Great War that we just came out of proved is that Indigenous people served, not as Indians, but they served as Americans and in the army. And thus, like their black brethren, should be granted citizenship and civil rights.” And of course this is a very cynical take. Arthur V. Watkins was a Mormon senator from Utah who was essentially going after large, land-based tribes because he understood the political power that they played in western states like Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, and North Dakota. And the way that he envisioned getting out of “the Indian business” was through deployment of civil rights discourse, and he went so far as to quote the Emancipation Proclamation, to say, essentially, “Break the shackles. These people shall be free.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:It’s quite cynical, because in reality it was a continuation of the politics of the Dawes Act of privatizing and assimilating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The problem with Indian people is that we’ve always been on land desired by settlers, and so how do you get us off the land has always been the issue. You can no longer kill us, so we will remove you or terminate your political power to essentially claim that land anymore. And so that’s what termination set out to accomplish. They terminated a handful of tribes, some of them are still working for recognition to this day. The Menominee were the hardest hit, losing a very successful and lucrative timber business that they had in Wisconsin. Under Ada Deer, who was a famous Menominee activist who was the Secretary of Indian Affairs and the first Indigenous woman to serve in that role and under the Department of the Interior, she got her tribe federally recognized again and fought tooth and nail. But they never really reclaimed that status that they had prior to termination. The really sad irony is that the next woman to serve as Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs is Tara Sweeney who was appointed under Ryan Zinke, who just left the Department of Interior. But Tara Sweeney is an Alaskan Native woman and also a former oil lobbyist who, as part of her first act in this position, was to take Mashpee Wampanoag land out of trust. And it was the first time that that had happened since the termination era. We’re kind of back on the other end of that pendulum; we’re swinging back towards a really dark time, especially under the Trump administration. The new policy of the federal government isn’t so much to overtly manage our affairs so much as to inscript us, as tools of the state, to begin our own dissolution and to expand the reach of the settler state. And what I mean by that is––it happens with federal preference laws in gaining contracts, specifically through Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. So you have the Cherokee Nation who is building state department buildings in the Green Zone in Baghdad, and who is also gaining lucrative contracts in border security, and who is creating pre-check systems for Mexican citizens who are traveling to the United States, to make sure that they won’t stay here longer. And then you also have Alaska Native corporations who have invested heavily in oil and gas, but are also gobbling up defense contracts and building and expanding military bases in places like Guam, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere, while also investing in the hiring of personnel at these detention facilities that are detaining migrants. And at the same time you have an imposed scarcity in the federal budget, where at one point in time there was a guaranteed lump sum that was always allocated to Indigenous nations under Nixonian self-determination policies, we now have to compete for that funding. And we’re almost like nonprofits, where we apply for a grant to get a new hospital, to get a new clinic, or new roads, and we end up competing with each other in a limited pool of funding. And so these defense contracts actually become a way to subsidize our economies. And it’s something that, as Indigenous people, we see it in our communities. And the direction that the idea of nationhood is going is aligning further and further with the U.S. imperial project, and many of us are very wary of it, but it’s something that hasn’t really broken the mainstream. And in the meantime, there’s also a strategic targeting of our natural resources. Under Obama, and then more so under Trump, the opening of so-called “public lands” through the Bureau of Land Management for resource exploitation, to the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs along watersheds. Previously, the Bureau of Indian Affairs regional headquarters were organized according to tribal location. So, before Zinke left office, he had proposed a reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs according to watersheds. So, for example, in the Northern Plains, where I’m from, it will be to the Upper Missouri River Basin. And instead of drawing the natural geography of that area, that region will be defined by state boundaries, which is hugely problematic for us because we don’t negotiate with the states for our water rights. We have to negotiate with the federal government, but a lot of folks fear that this is putting more pressure to go after specifically water, because these new regions are organized around watersheds. So this is the era that we’re in right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And what about the history of these contradictions within termination politics, whereby Native people are pushed into cities and towns for the purposes of assimilation and land privatization as well, but white settlers don’t want them there. Because it’s precisely that repression and violence that takes place, within this contradiction in termination, within which the American Indian Movement emerges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Termination removed around three quarters of a million Native people off reservations into far off urban centers, such as San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, New York, and Cleveland, Ohio. The goal of this project was essentially to isolate people as individuals or individual families, but Indians ended up finding each other in these urban centers and began forming Indian centers, where they could meet socially and culturally and be Indigenous within an urban context. We often talk about the families being removed to these places to be assimilated within mainstream U.S. society, but we often don’t talk about how children were specifically targeted. So, for example, in 1969, 1 in 3 Native children had been adopted out to white families. Most of those adoptions happened within state department of social services that specifically targeted those families and specifically targeted those mothers as “unfit” to care for children. The promise was the “gift” of white civilization. The reason why this happened was because these children were no longer in tribal schools. They were being enrolled in public schools, which increased the surveillance of Native families and children by social services, who then began targeting them for placement into foster care, but then eventually adoption into white families. This happened with great effectiveness in places like Minneapolis, Minnesota. And it is partially why the American Indian Movement formed. It was formed, yes, to combat police violence against Native people who were visiting the city for the weekend, or who were just blue collar workers and were letting off steam at a bar, and then were being harassed by police on the weekend and then imprisoned and thrown in jail and locked up. It was a response to that intense level of police violence, but it was also––a lot of the founders of the American Indian Movement were women, such as Pat Bellinger, who went on to create things such as the survival schools in Minneapolis to provide alternative education for Native children, and to provide what we now know as Native Studies. The other aspect of it is, in smaller more rural locations like where I’m from, I was born and raised in a place called Chamberlain, South Dakota. Chamberlain is a white dominated border town next to the Crow Creek Reservation and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe where I’m from. So when they flooded our lands in the 1950s and then later again in the 1960s, we were removed twice; we were removed by the first dam and then removed by the second dam. And we faced an existential crisis: would we exist as a nation after the destruction of our homelands, the destruction of our agriculture, our ranching businesses, and our entire way of life? Would we still be Kul Wicasa? Would we still be Lower Brule people after our lands were taken and after our families were relocated? And the proposal that was put on the table by the Bureau of Indian Affairs was essentially that we would move all of the Indian services into a place like Chamberlain. And this happened with other reservation border towns as well. We’d move all of the reservation services that were once at the agency headquarters of the tribe, that are now sitting underwater, to this white-dominated city. That means that the children would be integrated within the school system, there would be some integration within hospitals, and within social and cultural life. This is a time of desegregation, and these white rancher families were advocates; they were the ones who were promoting termination at the state level because Public Law 280 granted the right of the state itself to essentially terminate tribes in South Dakota. Some white legislators got together and said yes, we want to implement Public Law 280, which would grant criminal and civil jurisdiction of the state on reservation lands, effectively terminating them. This worked in tandem with the flooding of our bottom lands. So the dams themselves and the floodwater itself was like a literal manifestation of termination policy. It destroyed our lands, so it performed the function of termination and relocation. Yet when the very threat of us moving off reservation into these white-dominated communities began to be a real reality for them, they began to write violently racist diatribes against the relocation of Indigenous peoples within their community. So it presented a problem; “we want Indigenous land, but we don’t want Indigenous people.” Our ancestors, during that time, they were smart people, they understood. They played on the racism of South Dakota and they understood the laws. They understood that South Dakota is this unique state, in the sense that it has the option for referendums. These Sioux tribes, specifically in the western part of the state, got together and they said, “You know what, we need to pressure the state legislator to put this termination bill up for a public referendum and let the people decide. Let’s have a plebiscite, essentially.” Our leaders went around to these white communities and told them, “We will now be living amongst you.” And it scared the shit out of them. I think there was upwards of 80 percent voter turnout in Native communities––I think it’s the most voter turnout we’ve ever had historically––who voted against termination. And then also these white communities voted against termination, explicitly for racist reasons. So it was a huge victory for us, but the context of it is really quite funny and interesting because that’s been a problem to this day. So Chamberlain, South Dakota, where I was born and raised, was one of the most virulently opposed to this integration policy and actually said that they were going to essentially go out and lynch people who would rent to Native people moving to the town. So I was born and raised in that town and it wasn’t a cool thing to be an Indigenous person growing up. There was a lot of racism. And to this day, that high school won’t allow the singing of Indigenous honor songs for their graduates, even though the Indigenous students make up about a third of the school population. And when I was going there there was like five of us. We all just kind of kept our heads down, as far as not trying to raise too many issues. But the demographic shift that’s happening in these border towns is interesting, and there’s a lot of tension. To this day, even the state of South Dakota Education Department is boycotting hosting any events in Chamberlain, because it refuses to honor the honor song. The legacies of termination and the legacies of these policies have been ingrained within the cultural attitudes of everyday settlers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I’d like to talk more about the American Indian Movement. What was the Indigenous political history that it emerged from? The legacy of organizations like the Society of American Indians, The National Congress of American Indians, The National Indigenous Youth Federation? And how is it shaped by that history and also by this moment of Third World revolt that it emerged within? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:The American Indian Movement was one of many Indigenous organizations of what we now know as the Red Power Movement. And actually the term “Red Power” came from Clyde Warrior, who was one of the founders of the National Indian Youth Council. He had attended a speech by Stokely Carmichael and he heard him use this term “Black Power,” and then he almost immediately started using that term as well. And actually “Red Power” was put in print before “Black Power” was put in print. So the American Indian Movement was one of many organizations at the time, and what set it apart from these other groups is that it really came from the lower class of Indigenous people who were living off reservation. The American Indian Movement (AIM) literally was founded in prisons when people were incarcerated, and they were reading about these Third World movements that were happening all around the world, and the Civil Rights Movement, and the Black Power Movement. They formed in 1968, really kind of late in the development of Red Power ideology, so they had a lot to build on. They weren’t really inventing anything. They were just being a militant vanguard of the Red Power movement. And there’s a lot of criticism because of that, because they arrived late on the scene and they had this hot five years from 1968 to 1973 and then they just kind of burned out. That’s the typical narrative. I would argue that AIM was a vehicle, and it actually was a long-lasting vehicle, and it existed beyond the Wounded Knee occupation. But in relationship to these other organizations at the time, I wouldn’t see them as competing necessarily, I would just say that AIM was the loudest, AIM was the meanest, and AIM was the proudest of them all. It had that kind of proletarian militancy to it that these other movements just didn’t have. It was not just thinking about embedding itself in the city, but it was looking at, “How do we unite the rural countryside with the city organizations?” And so it was actively going back into these communities and seeking out, “So if we really are a nation then who are our leaders and what is our government structure?” And going back to those historic and traditional structures of the elder societies of the treaty councils. And so the treaty councils, they never really invented them, they were already existing. AIM just became  a weapon of them or a tool of the treaty council. So, if we look at the Society of American Indians, it was an iteration of a pan-Indigenous movement that was really the brainchild of boarding-school-educated activists, but also the grassroots treaty council people as well. They said, “We need doctors. We need lawyers to essentially take our treaty case to Congress.” And so, in many ways, AIM was just another iteration of that. And very much a product of its time in the sense that it was in this moment of great uprising, not just within North America, but across the world. And it very much saw itself as part of a global decolonization movement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:In one passage of your book, you allude to Marx, writing, “While traditional historians merely interpret the past, radical Indigenous knowledge keepers aim to change the colonial present and to imagine a deep colonial future by reconnecting to Indigenous places and histories.” How has Marxism informed your analysis? How do you relate a system of knowledge forged amidst the birth of the European working class to Indigenous American forms of knowledge? And finally, what do both forms of knowledge, together and in dialogue with one another, offer for this broader project of anti-capitalist, anti-colonialist liberation? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:When I first read Capital I was really bored for the first half of it, and it wasn’t until the latter quarter of the book, where he begins talking about colonialism. As you said, this is something that emerged in European working class ideology. Marx was creating a project that was incomplete, and he knew it was incomplete, and it was full of all these holes. It doesn’t make his project any less important, but if we look at that period at the end that he’s talking about in the expansion of capitalist markets abroad, what we now know is colonialism and imperialism, he’s fundamentally looking at what he calls “primitive accumulation.” There’s been a lot written on it, and I think it’s been over-theorized in many ways, because primitive accumulation is essentially expropriation. And expropriation is a building block for settler colonial societies. It has a beginning, but it doesn’t have an end. There are just different forms of expropriation and different rounds of expropriation. Whether it’s the construction of oil pipelines, or the mining of gold, or the taking of land, it’s a form of expropriation. And so how we are racialized and inscripted into the capitalist project is through dispossession. Marxism is fundamentally a study of power because it centers class, and class is about power. In a settler colonial society power relations are structured, not to be too reductive, between the binary of the settler and the Native. And so this informs my analysis. And I was somebody who identified as an anarchist because of its working class tradition. I read people like Emma Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Kropotkin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Kropotkin, yes. I very much loved Kropotkin, especially the concepts of mutual aid and his study of natural societies and his critique of Social Darwinism specifically. I read Marx when I was in college. I read “The Communist Manifesto” and it spoke to me in many ways, not just because of its analytical power, but because of the way it argued for organizing society from the ground up. Then I began to look at all of the things that I had been reading around anti-colonialism and realizing all of my favorite authors, Fanon, specifically, he was a Marxist. And the reason why somebody who was a descendant of a slave from the Caribbean could be an anti-colonial revolutionary in Algeria was because of internationalism and this idea of anti-colonial struggle as a global movement. And it primarily circulated through these Marxist, left, socialist, and communist traditions. But the problem with Marxism in the United States is that it has ignored one of the fundamental contradictions that has created what we now know is U.S. capitalism and imperialism, and that is settler colonialism. And by reading the theories of settler colonialism I see the hints of a Marxist analysis there. For myself as a historian, you know Marx is a student of history, and I became a historian not to really glorify the past, but to understand the present and what is required to undo the nightmarish present. And by thinking about these histories, not in this idealistic way, but in a very concrete and material way, we can think about the project that confronts us with decolonization. I do want to say something about––within Indigenous studies itself there is an anti-communist and anti-Marxist tradition. Ward Churchill has famously edited a book called. Russell Means has a an essay in there called “For America to Live, Europe Must Die,” which is essentially an anti-Marxist polemic. The reason why am ending with this is because this is something I’m taking on in the next project. In this moment, Russell Means has left the American Indian Movement. He begins criticizing a lot of these national liberation movements for taking up socialism and Marxism, which is a far cry from where he was six years prior to that, where he was embracing any and all potential allies to taking treaty rights to the United Nations, and by specifically supporting organizations or national liberation movements, such as the Sandinistas. So there’s this interesting history there that I want to fully develop more and look at, and look at these nuances of why there would be such a robust anti-Marxist tradition within Indigenous intellectual histories within North America, specifically, but then categorically look at a place like Bolivia, which has developed Indigenous socialist and left traditions and has embraced, in many ways, and furthered, many of Marx’s analyses. Or looking at Peru with Mariátegui, who is thinking about national liberation in the context of Indigenous people in the international. Or looking at even Indigenous Marxists of the past, such as Archie Phinney, who was a Nimiipuu or Nez Perce anthropologist trained by Franz Boas and then studied abroad in the Soviet Union in 1936 and 1937 to understand Soviet Indigenous policies. But his entire scholarship has been erased because there’s such an anti-Marxist tradition, not just within Indigenous studies but within the U.S. academy, that we can’t look at one of the founders of the most important organizations for American Indians in the 20th century, in the 21st century, the National Congress of American Indians. Archie Phinney studied in the Soviet Union for two years and founded this organization, but what was his story? We are missing so much in our own tradition as Indigenous people by not looking at this. Not just in my opinion, but as a student of history, the most successful national liberation movements had some version of Marxism or some version of socialism as their future society that they were working towards. I think we would be remiss and we would engage in forms of U.S. exceptionalism to say we’re somehow not a part of that history, or to even understand the mechanics of decolonial thought and decolonial practice as removed from places like Africa and Asia, that they’re not important to our conversation. We’re actually doing ourselves an intellectual injustice by not looking at those traditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Well, Nick Estes, thank you very much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE:Thank you so much, Daniel. It was such a pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan’s lengthy interview with Nick Estes on his remarkable book 
Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance. The problem that settler colonialism was repeatedly trying to solve by unleashing such terrific violence—through massacres, by nearly eliminating the buffalo, in reservation confinement, in dominating the Missouri River—was not just indigenous people being in the way but also the existence of a larger relationship between indigenous people and the land, water and animals. The history of resisting this capitalist and colonialist dispossession has endured through the Water Protectors’ struggle at Standing Rock—which will, in retrospect, be remembered as a pivotal moment in the global struggle against climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps no more depressing situation in Western Europe than that which prevails in Italy: a coalition government between the far-right Lega party and the now subordinate, bizarre, amorphously anti-corruption, internet-fetishist, pseudo-directly democratic Five Star Movement. In other words, Italian politics is dominated by a viciously racist anti-migrant politics; the left, along with most traditional forces, is in utter disarray. Today, Lega, led by Interior Minister Mateo Salvini, runs Italian politics. But the bad news is maybe also the good news: Salvini has not solved Italy’s deep rooted economic problems, and so it’s quite possible that the very same instability that abetted his rise will ultimately lead to his downfall. Dan interviews David Broder, Lorenzo Zamponi and Marta Fana.&lt;/p&gt;

Contrary to conventional wisdom, Sanders isn’t unpopular with Black voters. In fact, he has done rather well with young Black people. But to win the primary and beat Biden, he must do a lot better.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three interviews: historians Linford Fisher, Christy Clark-Pujara and Joanne Melish, and Emily Owens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan conducted six interviews on capitalism and slavery at The Dig’s recent Slavery’s Hinterlands symposium here in Rhode Island. This first of two episodes begins with historian Linford Fisher, who explains that the English settlement of North America was a settler-colonial project that required genocidally dispossessing indigenous people of their lands. What you might not know is that a central tactic for that dispossession, in New England and Virginia alike, was the threat and actual enslavement of native people, including the widespread practice of forcing native youth to labor in English homes. Then historians Christy Clark-Pujara and Joanne Melish, who pick up where Fisher leaves off: slavery wasn’t the South’s peculiar institution; it was the bedrock of the northern economy. And finally, historian Emily Owens on sexual labor under slavery: what, Owens’ work explores, did slavery and freedom mean for women for whom, in brothels or the home, sex was work? On the next episode, Dan has two more interviews looking at the big picture questions of slavery, capitalism, revolution and colonialism, and an interview with a group of public historians who teach about slavery today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Donna Haraway’s work defies disciplines, combining insights from both biology and feminist thought, and drawing on her own involvement in political projects organized around feminism and radical science. Haraway’s most recent book, 
, takes up these questions as the fragility of earth’s webs of life is becoming frighteningly and increasingly apparent. What are the ethical and political demands in the face of the most pressing threat of our era—catastrophic climate change? To stay with the trouble, Haraway argues, is to reject technofixes that will save us from doom on the one hand, and on the other, to reject the pessimistic idea that “it’s too late” to make the world better. The book outlines a view of what Haraway calls “multispecies flourishing” and the obstacles to achieving it through theoretical insights and speculative fiction imaginings. Interviewed by 
 editorial board member Alyssa Battistoni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Denvir:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Dig, a podcast from Jacobin Magazine. My name is Daniel Denvir and I’m back broadcasting once again from Providence, Rhode Island. I received a ton of electronically transmitted love in response to my remarkably lengthy monologue introduction to my interview on transportation idiocy with Kafui Attoh a few weeks back. About half of that intro was inspired by Kafui’s incredible book. The other half was inspired byCapital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State
, a book by my guest today Samuel Stein. As Stein writes, so-called livable neighborhoods have become synonymous with gentrified neighborhoods, and it’s tellingly a definition of livability that somehow excludes the two key things about city life that allow most people to actually live in a city: the price of shelter, and the price of labor. Even the term “young people” has become a euphemism for the small slice of that age cohort that business craves: affluent white youth. The system of real estate dominated capitalism that we live under has commodified not only public amenities like public transit and public schools. It has commodified the most basic ways that people think about public amenities and public spaces. And really, it has commodified the way we think about the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is gentrification? It isn’t just about what was once known as the hipster and is still known as the artist––the telltale warning signs of impending demographic change. Rather, gentrification is part of an entire political economic order that has made real estate global capitalism’s most prized asset for storing wealth. One that has helped bend place-based urban governments to the will of mobile, and thus more powerful, capital. Real estate has played a long game. For starters, the settler colonial project that built the American empire was, of course, about land. First, that land was violently stolen from Indigenous people in the name of white settler empire. Simultaneously, however, it was gobbled up by voracious speculators, railroads, and other capitalist interests. The result was that the so-called “closing of the frontier” in the late 19th century, revealed that the frontier had never been truly open for most people who didn’t own the means of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate has ever since always found a way to put itself at the center of American capitalism. In the New Deal in the period that followed, real estate capitalists took federal dollars to build whites-only suburbs, cordoning off the cities as ghettos to be asphyxiated under segregation-enforced capital flight. Meanwhile, urban neighborhoods, particularly those home to Black people, were destroyed in the name of renewal. And this was nothing new. The creation of Central Park in the 1850s destroyed Seneca Park, the largest Black settlement in Manhattan. One important point here is that we have never had some mythically libertarian housing or land policy in this country. We’ve had huge government intervention, but only of a very particular and regressive sort. Today, the real estate industry is madly profiting from those livable spaces that were made scarce by those same real estate capitalists’ project of mass, automobilized suburbanization. In other words, the very same forces that have turned vast swaths of this country into a soulless suburban wasteland are now, in response, charging an exorbitant premium on what little pleasant urban space was left behind, expelling the poor people of color who had inhabited and cared for those neighborhoods during their generation of neglect, disinvestment, and mass incarceration. And now, ironically, this very same process of elites moving into the city to appropriate the scarce luxury of dense city life is producing the very sort of suburbanized street-killing processes that undermine this luxury in the first place. Hideous, anti-human megadevelopments like Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s West Side; chain drugstores and bank branches supplanting a once diverse mix of storefronts across the borough; a train system that’s dying in streets more choked with traffic than ever, as those who can flee the trains do so into Ubers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, Donald Trump. Trump, writes Stein, is “a product and an embodiment of real estate capital’s global ascendancy.” As Stein shows, the president’s wealth was built upon the foundation of his grandfather Friedrich’s business, which was buying and selling brothels, and engaging in the sort of land speculation that defined the railroad-guided westward expansion of this country. And then, second, profiting from the rising land values that followed the construction of the Queensboro Bridge and the extension of subway lines to Queens, both of which connected that outer borough to Manhattan. Then Trump’s dad, Fred, who, when he wasn’t busy getting arrested at a Klan rally, expanded the empire by taking advantage of the Great Depression’s housing crisis and the New Deal spending on defense housing, to build government-financed homes that became infamous for excluding Black people. Fred Trump was even a lead developer on a massive and massively destructive urban renewal project in Brooklyn’s heavily Black Fort Greene neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Donald took over, and he moved his racism and graft-built government-subsidized family business to Manhattan, where he used his political connections to siphon off massive public subsidies and accelerate the deindustrialization of New York for his own private profit. First, Trump used the ascendant New York real estate state to build. And then, after becoming a too big to fail debtor, he became a grand, all-purpose huckster. Trump was by no means one of the biggest players in the housing market, but it’s still pretty amazing that he helped create the crisis by selling subprime mortgages, then profited from that crisis by teaching people how to flip foreclosed homes. And then of course, he politically capitalized on the resulting contradictions in American political economy to win the presidency. All of this and more is covered in Stein’s book which I highly recommend that you read. Okay. That’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay here’s Samuel Stein, a PhD candidate in geography at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and the author ofCapital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State
, out now from Verso Books. I interviewed Stein recently at a live event at Riffraff Books here in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Samuel Stein, welcome to The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel Stein:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
We should start by highlighting the really stark reality that people are facing in terms of housing. You write that there’s not a single county in the United States where a full-time minimum wage worker can afford the average two-bedroom apartment. In New York City alone nearly two million people pay the majority of their income to landlords every month. Homelessness, and attempts to criminalize and invisibilize it and eliminate homeless people from public space, are all rampant. So, before we get into a ton of detail about the political economy of real estate, which is what your book is about, could you start by explaining what life is like right now for people living under this system that you call the real estate state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah there is pretty widely recognized a housing crisis in this country, in almost, basically in all of its cities, but around the world as well. In this country homeownership is at a 50-year low. A record number of homes are being sold to absentee landlords––we hit 37 percent a couple of years ago. We have two million people homeless in this country, and another 7 million precariously housed. And I think as a lot of us are familiar, wages are relatively stagnant as housing costs are going up, which creates a real scissor effect for residents. And we talk about rent burdens in the housing world as the amount of your income that you pay towards rent. The federal government says 30 percent is what we should be paying––30 percent or less. And that even is an inflated number: it used to be 25 percent. But most people, or a lot of people, are paying a lot more than that, and it’s deeply racially segmented. So, the average, in mostly white neighborhoods, rent burdens are about 33 percent. In mostly African American neighborhoods, they’re 44 percent. In Latino neighborhoods it’s 47 or 48 percent. People are paying huge amounts of the incomes that they’re making, which are insufficient, to landlords – you can think of it as a pretty direct transfer of capital from employers to building owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You write that real estate worldwide is now worth 217 trillion dollars which adds up to 60 percent of all of the assets in the world, and most of that is in housing. Why is it that capital has been flocking to real estate at this particular moment in the long history of capitalism? What have been the constant and changing roles laid by land and real estate within the global political economy? And putting it in some historical context, how does this fit in to the broader transformation in the global economies since the neoliberal turn in the 1970s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think it’s worth repeating that statistic that 61 percent of the world’s assets are invested in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s an astonishing number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s a majority of global capital and it’s never been the case before. So real estate has always been a factor in capitalism––it’s certainly always been a factor in urban politics––but never to quite this extent. And I don’t think there’s any one reason that you can point to that explains the whole thing. But if we think of a few reasons in combination: just global inequality in general has created the need for a whole bunch of money to go somewhere, and a lot of that is going to particular metropolitan areas that are becoming hyperinvested, New York where I live being a prime example, London another. So there’s a lot of very rich people who are looking for something to do with their money and are a little bit worried about keeping it in their own country, or in a bank account, and real estate is doing quite well right now and so that becomes the global safe deposit box. One reason that real estate is doing so well right now, in this country especially, has to do with deregulation of finance over the last 25 or so years, which has unleashed all sorts of derivatives that grew out of the housing market. There are all sorts of things you can do with housing you couldn’t do before. So, it becomes not just a place to live but a way to turn money into a lot more money. The whole quantitative easing program that the federal government has been undertaking, or had undertaken in the Obama era, meant that the Federal Reserve bought out a whole bunch of assets from banks which was meant to create liquidity which it sort of did. But the thing that all the banks did with that money was basically put it in real estate. There was no point in holding onto it––interest rates were incredibly low. So as long as the real estate bubble was getting bigger, which it was even after the financial crisis, that became the place that capital moved into. We’ve seen massive urbanisation programs in China, in Dubai, and in other countries that have to do with the local political system there, but also have to do with transformations of agriculture. So as agriculture is being mechanized and globalized, peasant lifestyles are harder and harder to maintain, and more and more people are moving into cities which creates opportunities for more construction development and ultimately exploitation. So, all these things are happening at the same time creating the conditions we’re in now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And where does the restructuring of the global economy, beginning with the crises of the 1970s and the shift towards neoliberalism––why is that so conducive to the rise of real estate capital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 A whole bunch of reasons. One thing has to do with the falling rate of profit. So, as a lot of industries were becoming less profitable than they might have been otherwise, investors were moving money out of those industries and into other sectors and real estate became a key location for that capital to move to. Capital gains were rising as rates of profit were falling. So that’s one reason that hit a particular crisis point in the early 70s. Another was deindustrialization, which is really industrial restructuring or geographical shifting of industrial production––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
Because it goes somewhere––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It goes somewhere. The world is more industrial now than it’s ever been. But First World central cities are not the place where most of that industrial production is happening. And that had started in a first wave after World War II, moving production out to the immediate suburban areas outside cities. But it really took off in the 70s and picked up steam in the 80s and 90s, to the point that manufacturing was leaving big cities in a big way. In New York City for example, between the 50s and the 90s, the City lost 750,000 manufacturing jobs. So that turn created all sorts of opportunities which we can think of as a vacuum. It was an economic vacuum that had to be filled by a different kind of economic development. Real estate was a huge part of that as was the financial sector and insurance. It also created a political vacuum in that a new class of capital came to be dominant in cities like New York and many others. And that was the decline of the political significance of manufacturers and the rise of political power of real estate. And then the final one is a spatial vacuum. So as manufacturing leaves these places, there’s all these buildings leftover, one of which we’re in right now––in a former manufacturing space that’s been turned over to a very nice retail space. But as manufacturing capital left these cities they left behind huge amounts of space. Some of that space like this building gets preserved and turned over to another use; some gets demolished and then built up in the image of what the real estate developers want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And another piece of context there is that it’s these huge changes that take place in things like transportation and logistics that lead to massive transformation in how different sorts of spaces are valued within capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And so suddenly a place like Elizabeth, New Jersey becomes incredibly attractive because you can build out new port infrastructure that would completely displace almost all of New York City’s port economy, which was New York’s competitive advantage for centuries. So, the logistics revolution changes the geography of industrial development in a way that creates all sorts of opportunities for real estate capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You just mentioned that industrial and real estate capital are very two distinct forms of capital that make very different sorts of demands on the city and thus shape very different sorts of cities. And in part that’s because they tend to view the value of land in very different ways. Explain the difference between these two different types of capital and what that has meant for the economics and politics of real estate in the many cities, that over the last more than half century, have experienced deindustrialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah I think this is one of the most important points I wanted to make in my book, so I’m glad you asked. We often paint capital as one thing, when it is many different forms of capitalist accumulation that are sometimes in competition with one another. And in cities for a long time the two most powerful groupings were industrial capital, representing manufacturers, distributors, warehousers, and real estate capital, representing developers, landlords, real estate brokers, and that whole ecology of accumulation. Sometimes they had similar interests, but they had certain differences that turned out to be politically useful, and that became very important for urban planners to mediate. So, if we think about a moment when both industrial capital and real estate capital is very powerful in cities, both are making certain claims on the state, certain demands on the state. They don’t want to admit that they like planning. They like to give the image that the market will settle everything. But in truth, both industrial and real estate capital need certain things from the state. They both need certain kinds of infrastructure, for example. If there aren’t transportation networks, electronic networks, waterworks, they can’t do business, their entire model is worthless. So, they’re dependent on the state, and its coordination and planning, to provide those things. Industrial capital is very much concerned with state––what they would call––overreach around environmental protection. They don’t want to see limits on where and how much they can pollute. Real estate capital tends to support environmental regulation if it makes more land livable and buildable. Industrial capital tended to support affordable housing programs, whether that be rent control or in some cases even public housing. And it’s not because they were a wonderful caring capitalist. It’s because if their workers were paying less in rent they would have lower demands of them in terms of wages. So industrial capital could support affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate capital had no interest in anything that would lower rents and bring down the value of land. Industrial capital likes cheap land because it makes stuff on land. Buildings and land are costly for a manufacturer or distributor or warehouser. For real estate capital, land values are the very thing that they trade in. They want to buy low and sell high. So, they want to see land values going up and up and up once they hold onto land. So, they were making different kinds of claims on the state. The working class of course was making an entirely different set of demands but could sometimes partner with one of those two groups to have a more powerful voice in city politics. So, planners were trying to negotiate the shifting or the contradictory demands of industrial and real estate capital, while maintaining popular legitimacy. And so if the first was a contradiction within the capitalist class, there’s a second contradiction that planners are trying to resolve, which is making sure that the capitalists get what they need while also involving the public enough to have popular legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Those two sets of contradictions potentially allow for the public to exercise more power by pitting those people, those forces, against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. They can work one against the other in different ways at different times. There’s strict limits put on popular power within urban planning during this period, so people are consulted but they don’t necessarily have the power to change the rules in ways that would threaten the bottom line of either industrial capital or real estate capital. So, the way I describe it in the book, is systems that are open but rigged. You have a say, but your say can’t overturn the system, it can choose between options that are given. But that was a moment when, as you say, popular voices had a little bit more power and the division within the capitalist class was useful, socially useful, in terms of getting things like rent control, some public housing, also some environmental regulations on the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There can be a coincidence of interests if industrial capital wants land cheap for their own reasons, and also have an ancillary interest in land being cheap enough for their workers to be able to afford to live near the factories. There can be coincident interests between them and their workers on that subject. But then with the flight of industry, that leaves real estate capital alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. There is no longer such an intercapitalist feud going on in most cities. Which leaves a whole lot of power for real estate to make claims on the state. To say, please act in a way that drives land values upward. Please act in a way that stops restricting our ability to extract higher and higher rents. Capital still makes all sorts of requests and demands of city planners, but those demands are mostly going in one direction, which is more expensive, more gentrification. Groups that are against that sort of thing, we organize as tenants, we organize as a housing movement, but we’re in a structurally more complicated, more difficult position in terms of challenging capital’s hold on the urban planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The last question I want to ask about deindustrialization before we move on, is that one thing I like about your book is how it really forces us to think about it in a more expansive way. When people think about deindustrialization they usually think about places like Detroit, or Camden, New Jersey, but Detroit and Brooklyn are, in fact, part of the same and stuck in the same processes and parts of the same system. And geography is really critical because we need to understand how, what Marxist geographers call “uneven geographic development,” functions within capitalism. Explain the way that various places get whiplashed between gentrification and disinvestment, and why there’s such a fixed dynamic that allows for so little stable ground between Manhattan and Camden, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
Right. Yeah. I mean there’s all sorts of other urban environments, economic modes that we can imagine, that would be neither hypergentrification nor hyperdisinvestment, but real estate driven political economy pushes cities toward one or the other direction. It sorts places out, the places that are going to be overinvested in, and the places that are going to be severely disinvested. Part of this is that one creates the condition for the other. So severely disinvested places are places where you can also buy land cheap, invest in it, and raise rents, and ultimately produce the conditions for gentrification. Severely hypergentrified places are susceptible to real estate crashes, which could drive down property values once again, which then creates another round of opportunities for reinvestment. And so the two tend to depend on each other. And another important element of this uneven geographical development that you talk about is capital flowing from one place to another. So, if we look at, for example, city-suburb relations, there was a long period in US mid-century development where capital was moving out of cities and into suburbs. In a lot of places, we’ve seen the opposite and we’ve seen poverty in inner ring suburbs and extreme wealth in cities. And that dynamic works really well for capitalism because once again, each side produces the opportunity for the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And capital, as Marx said, is value in motion––it needs to be moving, it needs to be creating new value. And so having this unevenness creates the opportunity for new development all the time. There’s never a situation where an entire country is gentrified. It can’t happen. There needs to be investment as well as disinvestment for the system to operate. That doesn’t mean that there’s a one to one relation, where a dollar comes out of Detroit and goes into Brooklyn. But the two are always present. And in the U.S. right now we, I, talk a lot about gentrification. It covers a relatively small proportion of the surface area of the country. Far more of the country has experience capital flight and severe disinvestment. But that capital gets pulled really intensively into certain places, until it can’t anymore, and then there’ll be a new accumulation strategy that develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So let’s talk more about gentrification. What is gentrification? How does it work? And if it covers such a small area of total land in the U.S., why is it something that’s important for us to analyze if we’re to understand this bigger picture of uneven development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. Well first of all, even though it covers a relatively small proportion of the surface area of the country, like we said before a majority of the world’s capital is in real estate, and that real estate is concentrated in certain places very intensively. So, if we look at the proportion of capital investment in land and buildings, we’d see these hotspots. And so it is important if we want to understand the dynamics of 21st century capitalism to understand gentrification, even if it doesn’t affect most of the country at the same time. But I would argue that there’s a very close link between all the disinvested areas and all the reinvested areas. So for me, gentrification is the third phase in a process of investment, disinvestment, and reinvestment. So, money goes into a place, and it gets built up with a certain, often very nice built environment. Money then flows out of that place either because of changes in policy, changes in the economy, other opportunities elsewhere, and it becomes disinvested. And then gentrification is the return of capital to those disinvested spaces. As a geographer named Ipsita Chatterjee who defines gentrification as “the theft of spaces of labor and their conversion into spaces of profit.” I think that’s actually the definition I prefer. That if you think of space as socially produced, that takes a whole lot of labor of people who don’t necessarily have a whole lot of capital. People put their lives into building up not only their home but their neighborhood, in a way that makes it suddenly appealing to capital, which comes in and transforms spaces of labor into spaces of capital in a way that displaces those who built them up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And there are also historically particular ways that this has worked in the US where, for example, post-war suburbanization has made what we now call “livable spaces,” made those spaces scarce, and is now profiting from that scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. So. you’re saying that the suburban landscape was built out with massive federal subsidies––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And that aesthetic and lifestyle was valorized for a time––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And now if you want to live without a car you’re going to have a hard time in a lot of the built environment that was built out between the 1930s and the 1960s. And so yes, there’s then this scarce environment that people like for all sorts of reasons, some of which are economic. When gas prices went up in the early 70s––the period we were talking about before––a lot of people suddenly wanted to move to the city where they could use mass transit instead of relying on their car. When two family or two worker or households became the norm, it suddenly made a lot of sense to live a lot closer to where you were working, especially if you were raising children. So those changes took place that made these remaining so-called livable spaces highly competitive in a way that they weren’t before. We also need to look at the dynamics of redlining that created the suburbs and created the opportunity for people to get their FHA loans and their VA housing and everything else in the suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And these were explicitly racist policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Explicitly. It’s not that we have to extract the racism from it. We coded just about every neighborhood in every residential area in the 30s and 40s, and we looked at how old the buildings were, and how much distance there were between them. But we mostly looked at race, and areas with any African American population were coded as risky investments, as places that were unsafe to lend. And places that were integrated were shaky. And so integrated places were given every incentive to become segregated places. And especially African American, but also Latino and Asian populations, were clustered into the remaining redlined area. So that’s how we get the disinvestment that then produces the condition for gentrification afterward. The banks were told not to lend to particular areas and actually got to choose those areas themselves––the Homeowners Loan Corporation was mostly made up of bankers who could then decide which areas should be loaned to and which areas should not. So then we have massive disinvestment from central cities in a way that then becomes the opportunity for the kind of cultural avant-garde of semi-wealthy people in the 60s and 70s to buy up the brownstones, to move into the lofts, because they had been severely disinvesting that made them affordable to them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There’s a certain aesthetic and cultural critique of gentrification that focuses on the artists moving into a poor neighborhood, or not so long ago it was the figure of the hipster. And it’s certainly true that artists and people with high cultural capital are often precursors to gentrification, but it seems like too much of a myopic focus on artists and whoever else mystifies at least two things. First, that artists, etc., themselves don’t have anywhere else to live except maybe where they’re able to afford rent which is in these soon-to-be gentrifying neighborhoods. And, two, it seems to miss that the artist is used by real estate capital, rather than the other way around. What’s your take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think that’s right. I think there are certain artists who embrace their role as a gentrifier, and who try to be useful to real estate capital in a way that’s pretty disturbing. But for many artists they don’t have any place else to go––they go where they have cheap rents, but also a lot of space which often tends to be post-industrial areas that real estate capital is kind of waiting for somebody to make cool again. And then real estate capital absorbs the labor that artists put into remaking these spaces, raises the rent, kicks out the artists, and brings in the newer, higher rent paying tenants. So that’s the game that we’ve seen over and over and over again. You can’t just blame the artist necessarily; you also can’t take away their capability. But the artist, the hipster, tends to be the most visible element of gentrification, in a similar way as retail is. Like you notice when the stores change, but the stores don’t tend to change until after the demographics have already changed. But who lives in a large brick building is not necessarily clear until the retail at the bottom changes. So, I think people have sometimes reversed the order in which these things happen. The artist, the hipster, certainly plays a role, but they alone can’t make gentrification happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sometimes talk about the production explanation of gentrification and the consumption explanation. The production explanation looks at the landlords, the developers, the bankers, the people who put in the money to create a new built environment. The consumption explanation looks at the artists, the hipsters, the new bourgeoisie who move into these areas. There was a debate back and forth for a long time, that I think is fairly unproductive, because it doesn’t work if you don’t have both. If you have the production side of gentrification and a whole bunch of money goes into building out new areas, and is ready to make loans, but there is no class to consume that––there is no relatively wealthy people to move into these spaces, no artist to make them cool––it won’t work. And if you just have the consumption side, without the money going in for the loans, and the new apartments, to build out that built environment that these so-called cool, wealthy people want to live in, then that’s going to be a whole bunch of unmet demand. And I think what’s missing, then, is the role of the state. And part of what urban planners do is ensure that both the production side and the consumption side are there, which is the condition that you need to have a successful so-called gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There is a contrarian line of argument about gentrification which is that it’s not entirely bad. Most famously I think the scholar Lance Freeman did some ethnographic work that reports that people living in neighborhoods undergoing gentrification report a range of feelings about the changes that they’re seeing in their neighborhood. I know that you’re pretty familiar with his work and the debates around it. Explain his argument in his research, and where it fits into the debate, and what you make of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Sure. I don’t want to focus too much on just Lance Freeman alone. But he did write one of the most influential books and set of first quantitative, and then qualitative, studies about gentrification and his argument is often that it’s really not as bad as people think. Poor people move a lot. Their housing is always precarious because they don’t have the money to pay rent. So, for him, it’s methodologically problematic to say gentrification causes displacement––people would be moving otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And eviction takes place in huge numbers in neighborhoods that are not gentrifying by any means, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. Which is the other side of uneven geographical development. You don’t have the gentrification without the disinvestment. In the disinvested areas it’s not this working-class utopia where everyone can live cheap. It’s often the sum of the highest concentration of eviction. So then, Freeman goes out and interviews people in Harlem and in––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Fort Greene?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s not Fort Greene, it’s not Bed-Stuy it’s––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Clinton Hill––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s Clinton Hill, thank you. He goes out to Clinton Hill and he interviews people in Harlem, and he finds, as you’re saying, a range of feelings among long-term, mostly African American, mostly renters––not homeless––about gentrification. So, for me the methodological problem there is, you’re missing the displaced. They already moved out. So, you know, if you talk to the people who, for one reason or another, could ride the wave of gentrification, it’s less surprising that they enjoy the outcomes. Either because they live in a protected class of housing of some sort, maybe they’re rent stabilized and their landlord isn’t particularly aggressive, or they live in private housing and the owner knows them and isn’t going to raise their rent, or maybe they live in public housing and––for a long time, not so much now––they were more protected from the impacts of gentrification. They might enjoy the income mix but more than that I think they enjoy the public benefits that people associate with gentrification. So, after neighborhoods get gentrified, a whole bunch of public investment tends to be made in neighborhoods. The sanitation gets better. That’s the one that people talk about the most, is the garbage gets cleaned up faster and the snow gets pushed away quicker. The transit options tend to be better. Bike lanes go in where they didn’t have bike lanes before. And it’s not because people didn’t have garbage, ride bikes, or take buses before. It’s because the city reacts differently when wealthier and predominantly white people move into these neighborhoods. So of course if you live in the neighborhood and suddenly the sanitation got better and the transit got better you’re going to be glad for that. I think a lot of people want all those public benefits without the risk of displacement, of either themselves or their friends. Because there’s another way of thinking about displacement which isn’t about each individual tenant gets pushed out, it’s that people get displaced from their community, because their community no longer exists. Even if they are the relatively lucky ones who get to stay, their social networks or destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Freeman found something which is real, which is that people have mixed and complicated feelings about gentrification when they are able to ride it out. I think a lot of people in the media, a lot of planners, a lot of other researchers who had very different politics picked up on that reporting and said, “see gentrification is fine. People love it.” And that was really disingenuous, but then pervasive. And then those reports get cited. So, it spins out into this new logic that actually, people in the neighborhood love gentrification, it’s these sort of like outsiders who don’t understand the real dynamics, who are the ones making trouble. Which is kind of like an old red-baiting tactic that it’s the outside person coming into the community to stir up trouble, when really, we were fine with what was happening all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And also reflects this naturalization of real estate capitalism that it’s not even really thinkable, the idea that we could have the public amenities that everyone deserves without gentrification––that these two things could be delinked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. So, we can enjoy the benefits right now but only if they come as a result of real estate reinvestment, which only happens in cases that will result in displacement. So decoupling all those things is a really important political project for the Left, so that people can imagine the things that they want out of city investment without fearing the displacement that they now associate with that investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One related issue is that gentrification is sometimes described as a solution to the problem of segregation. But the integration achieved by way of gentrification has at least two problems. First, it’s not, almost ever, stable. You might have a brief period of integration, which is more of a snapshot, that, as the process continues to play out, is going to lead to the demographics being flipped in a neighborhood, and thus a perpetuation of segregation. And then second, it fails to confront the core driver of segregation which is exclusionary neighborhoods and suburbs. Explain a little bit about how the politics of class and racial segregation and integration––how that plays out in debates over gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Our current liberal mayor of New York City has embraced this idea that gentrification is a good way to undo the ill effects of segregation, which, he would rightfully say, was structurally produced through redlining, through blockbusting, through patterns of FHA lending, through patterns of highway construction. That’s all true. So, we produced the segregation in a way that it didn’t even necessarily exist in the prewar period. Brooklyn for example was far less segregated at the beginning of the twentieth century than it was at the end. But, gentrification as a solution to integration will ultimately displace the people who lived through long periods of disinvestment and segregation. So, people will then not get to benefit from the undoing of the dynamic that produced the conditions that they lived in for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because it’s in fact a perpetuation of the same dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SS:Right. It’s just flipping it again. We’re moving from disinvested to hyperinvested. Things don’t stay stable in between without a change in the political economy. Right now things are sorted out into those two areas. So yes there’s this moment when it looks like a nice balance but it has pretty quickly turned into a tipping point. I worked on a book called 
Zoned Out!that came out a couple years ago that looked at the zoning changes under Bloomberg and the beginning of what was happening under de Blasio in New York City. And we showed that there were many many many changes to the neighborhood zoning in New York City during this time, which were complicated. And if you looked at it as a whole, it was hard to make sense of any of it, unless you look at race. Race turned out to be the determinant factor in which neighborhoods were given protective rezonings, and which neighborhoods were given rezonings for intensive redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Protective rezoning is like a historic district or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 A historic district, a contextual rezoning––which means changing the zoning rules to match what’s there right now––or a downzoning, which means in the future people will only be able to build smaller than what’s here right now. So it wasn’t even, I said neighborhood before, but it’s really block by block, block by block by race, so white blocks––predominantly white blocks––got protected, predominantly African American, Latino, and Asian blocks were subject to big, new development. And so, the result of that ends up looking like integration. If you look at those prior, mostly Black, Latino, and Asian blocks, and you see there was this luxury development that was built and suddenly all these white people moved in, now something else is happening. But at the same time, they cut off the ability to build out low-income and mixed-race development on those white blocks. And so, they were channeling integration in one way and cutting it off in the other. It’s like a one-way street that’s going––there’s a one way street and you’re moving in the wrong direction. If we want to do integration, we need to unsegregate those white spaces. The problem is not the concentration of people of color in neighborhoods that they built up over a long period of segregation and disinvestment. So that in many cities the integration that’s happening is the exact wrong way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You describe the entirety of this complex of economic and political power as “the real estate state.” That doesn’t, of course, mean that the entirety of American capitalism or government is all about real estate. What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So I’m using that term the way people use “the welfare state,” “the carceral state,” “the warfare state,” as a way of expressing a faction of the state, or a block, and really a faction of not just the state, but an element of capital and an element of the state, like the military-industrial complex. We’ve got the military, the state, the industrial, as the forms of capital that are feeding off of military growth. I see the real estate state in a similar vein, as the combination of real estate capital in various forms with state power. We see that most directly at the local level because most urban planning in the US is done at the municipal level. We don’t have a national urban plan. We don’t have a national housing program. We also don’t have a national industrial program. We have state-by-state and really city-by-city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 We just have a national bank bailout program and a national imperialism program and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s convenient how that works. And we have a president who is a real estate developer. So, it’s not like this doesn’t exist at the federal level––it very much does. And so, we have the real estate developer for the president. We have our Treasury Department run by someone who helped Goldman Sachs get into the subprime industry, and then bought out a major subprime lender in California. He was known as the ‘Eviction King of California’ for a long time. He now runs the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Very cool. Yep. The head of the Housing and Urban Development agency is not a developer, but he is a person who is most famous in the housing world for arguing against federal intervention aimed at desegregation. The one piece of writing that he’s done on housing was about how HUD should do less to end segregation. That’s our HUD chair. So, it exists at the federal level––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Ben Carson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It exists at the federal level for sure. But at the city level it’s especially strong, because the city level is where those zoning decisions are made, where decisions about tax incentives for development are done––often either at the state or the city level––and so real estate can have a huge impact on urban politics. And so, the real estate state is the collusion between real estate developers, landlords, brokers, in some places homeowners and homeowner associations, on the one hand, and government at all scales but particularly at the local level through urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Looking at this story from the municipal level is also important, I think, in terms of understanding how neoliberalism, this big thing that changed the world, took root at the local level in the 1970s, amidst this fiscal crisis and capital strikes. Explain the political economy of municipal New York in the 70s, and how the crisis at that moment provided an opening for the rise of real estate, and for the restructuring of urban government, and more generally, how all of this laid the groundwork in cities all over the place for not only gentrification, but also the ongoing power of finance to discipline cities, bending them to the will of capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So, I live in New York. I study in New York. So, New York is the go-to example in my book even though it talks about many other cities throughout country, and to some extent throughout the world. New York was, many people believe, the test case for neoliberalism, not just at the urban level but at the global level. In the mid-1970s the city faced a severe fiscal crisis and was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. There are many different explanations for what happened. The mainstream and conservative version is, the city’s welfare state was just far too generous, and it couldn’t support that with the tax rolls that it was bringing in. I don’t really buy that, and I think it’s important to show that at that very moment when conservatives were saying that its welfare state was too generous, the city and state were giving enormous amounts of money to real estate. The financing of something like the World Trade Center, which was empty for a very long time, was done at massive cost to the taxpayer. So that’s where I tend to focus my ire. But it is true that the city was was nearing bankruptcy. And so a coalition forms of bankers, of the state government which was run by a banker’s brother, a Rockefeller, and they managed to bring in some of the biggest municipal labor unions. And so, the labor unions spent their pension money buying out a lot of the debt for New York City. The state put on really strict limitations in terms of what the city could do anymore. So, we lost control over our rent control laws, which went to the state level. We lost control of our taxation laws. We even lost control over our speed limits. All these things got taken away from the city and moved to the state level, while at the same time the bankers and the other financiers were demanding that the city restructure its political economy in a way that was beneficial to them. Slashing corporate tax rates, slashing stock taxes, creating more opportunity for real estate investment. And so, the entire city was restructured. Crisis was technically averted. The city never went into bankruptcy, but there was a pretty strong capital strike that it took decades to undo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Capital strike meaning that finance said, if you don’t do what we want, you won’t get loans for anything, you’ll be shut out of capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And this isn’t just a metaphor. They have municipal bond rating agencies that will meet with city governments and say, if you want your bonds to be worth anything, and if you want people to be buying those bonds, then you’re going to have to make certain changes. If you make those changes, we will rate you better. And if we rate you better, all the insurance and pension funds will start buying your bonds and you’ll be flush with cash. So, it’s not an abstract process, it’s not an impersonal process, it actually happens in meetings between city leaders and municipal credit rating agencies. And so, this happened in 1975. The city responded with a program that was notoriously called “planned shrinkage”, which meant actively disinvesting from the outer boroughs, the poorest areas, the concentration of people of color, and actively investing in the central city. And this is the moment when Donald Trump, who had gotten his start with his father building a different kind of housing in Queens and Brooklyn, moves over to Manhattan and takes full advantage of all these sudden––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Racist housing in Queens and Brooklyn––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Racist housing in Queens and Brooklyn, explicitly segregated, challenged by the federal government––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And a slumlord even in his segregated whites-only housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes, he was the worst as a slumlord in Virginia which was, so, yes he was a slumlord, he was a segregationist, he was arrested for being at a Ku Klux Klan rally. That’s the business that Donald Trump in inherited. But then he moves it across the river from Brooklyn and Queens into Manhattan and takes advantage of this moment where the city and the state are saying let’s get all the money we can into Manhattan as we pull the money out of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One critical thing about how capitalism functions at different scales of governance is that it helps us to understand how mobile, globalizing capital not only disciplines particular nation-states––which is how we often think about, you know, the American worker in competition with other workers and then downward pressure on regulations at the national level––but also it shapes government at every single level, and in different ways. And cities in particular are in maybe the toughest situation because they have so much less power over capital than the national or state governments. And this is my devil’s advocate, “what could cities do in this situation,” question. They really feel compelled to make themselves into maximally attractive honey pots for capital that will induce capital to sit still. You write that critics call this form of local prostration before capital “geobribery.” But to me, it’s also maybe more so “geoextortion,” because it’s capital, rather than municipal governments, that’s in the dominant position. And what’s more, because of the setup that we have in this country, municipal spending depends upon real estate taxes, which means that the funding for things that we like a lot––like education––is reliant upon driving real estate values as high as they can go. So, my question is, if you could explain the constraints that mobile capital imposes on cities, given the super reactionary system of devolved power that we have in this country? And, whether cities could have and can do differently in the face of what is essentially a constant standing threat of capital strike?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. I mean it’s important to set up those stakes so that we don’t think that it’s either an accident or just a set of bad choices that led to this situation we’re familiar with now. It is structural, and I think that’s frustrating for people to hear. It’s easier to imagine our way out if somebody made a bad move. We can say, let’s get rid of that person, replace them with somebody else who will make a good move. It’s not that individuals haven’t made choices here, but their choices have been really constrained by those two sets of dynamics we talked about: mobile capital, and then this combination of what we call devolution and centralization. So, to take the second one first, devolution and centralization produce another kind of scissor effect in the same way that wage stagnation and rising rents produce a scissor effect. But this is for municipal governments. Devolution is forcing of political responsibility to ever more local levels, from the federal to the state, from the state to the city, so that it becomes cities’ responsibilities to provide for all sorts of things that used to be at least aided, if not fully funded, by the federal government. Talking about mass transit for example; mass transit operations used to be heavily subsidized by the federal government––no longer. Public housing used to be mostly paid for by the federal government, and there have been severe cuts to that starting in the late 70s, accelerating in the 80s continuing in the 90s, and not really getting any better since––a couple blips up but nothing significant. So, cities are responsible for all these things, but they don’t have control over them. And that’s where the centralization comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government imposes all sorts of rules on what cities are and are not allowed to do. For example, we put a moratorium on the construction of new public housing in the late 70s, and then in 1996 I believe, there was an amendment added to a bill that said, cities can’t have a net increase in public housing or else they won’t get federal funding. The federal government is saying, cities you have to pay for public housing, but you can’t expand it. A similar sort of thing happens with rent control in a lot of places, where that would be an important immediate––not necessarily solution to the crisis of gentrification––but a very important tool in addressing it. Many states have rules saying that cities can’t institute rent control at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There was in Massachusetts––I forget when it was––a statewide referendum that eliminated rent control, I think just in cities like Boston and Cambridge. But it was voted on statewide, and narrowly passed, I think in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And in New York we have rent control or rent stabilization only in a few counties, but the entire state is what regulates it. So, it’s a state law, after 1975 when the state took it away from the city. So rural voters have a huge amount of sway over city rent laws, and that also allows urban real estate interests to give tons of money to rural politicians, who don’t care at all about rent control because it doesn’t affect their people, who then vote against it or vote to weaken it. So, devolution of responsibility with centralization of control really limits what cities feel they can do. Then you’ve got this mobile capital problem. Capital moves from place to place to place at quicker and quicker paces, especially, we think of finance capital which can move in milliseconds and doesn’t have to be grounded in any particular location except through real estate. Which is why real estate is such an important piece of the finance economy as lived city. And so, cities end up competing with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Or Amazon’s HQ2, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. That was a terrible, but very exemplary demonstration of this dynamic, where one company said, we’re going to one place––the lie, they have ended up saying they were going to two––and made cities compete for who could have the most––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Humiliate themselves publicly––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And humiliate themselves publicly, and keep their bids private, so even their residents wouldn’t know what their cities were promising to this one corporation owned by the richest person in the world. And that happens all the time. It was just a very visible demonstration of it. And in New York people got so furious that we were able to actually stop this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 If it made such less of a spectacle over it, just did it like they did with Hudson Yards or any of the other massive taxpayer giveaways to developers that happen every day, they might have gotten away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And so, the task of the housing movement, and of researchers and writers, is to generalize out from Amazon. To show people that this is actually continuing to happen all the time. And if we were against it with Amazon we should be against it with other companies, that similarly pit the vulnerabilities of local places against one another and force cities into this entrepreneurial state where they have to present themselves as the most generous in terms of tax breaks, the most lax in terms of labor standards, and the most lax in terms of environmental standards on top of that. It’s a race to the bottom quite explicitly, and it would take some sort of collective action to undo. So, there’s all sorts of things that cities can do differently right now, but very few are willing to be the ones that will risk the capital flight. So, unless there was some sort of organizing at a larger scale, it’s hard to find one city’s way out of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One of the saddest ironies, or realities, that you point out in your book is that it’s often the best planning, in a sense, that often fuels gentrification the most, because the value created by public amenities like nice parks, bike lanes, and perhaps most distressingly expanding public transit––that value is mostly appropriated by real estate capital. My question is, how, short of full communism, can we temper this? By substantially decommodifying public amenities, by decommodifying housing, maybe by delinking the relationship between public amenities and private real estate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s definitely the key task, so that people don’t just reject things that they would otherwise want in their neighborhoods out of the very well-founded fear that it will pave the way for their own displacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because, a new subway line does mean your rent is going up probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. And now it’s more and more structured so that, we’ll pay for the subway line through a tax that only kicks in when the property values go up. So, if the property values don’t go up, the whole thing goes bust. And if the property values go up, you’re going to have a hard time living there. So, the displacement is built in to the financing model of many of these projects. So, we need ways around it. As you said decommodifying land and housing is ultimately what we need. In the meantime, rent control is a pretty effective way of delinking those two things because if rents can only go up based on either an annual accrual rate or an actual change to the property itself, then you are already delinking what happens in the surrounding neighborhood and the public investment that goes into it from the private benefit of the landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often talk about rent control is important for all sorts of other reasons but this to me is a crucial one. If you want a park in your neighborhood, and you don’t have rent control, it’s economically against your interests to lobby for that park to be created because you know that it will raise your rent. If you have rent control, you can have that park, and you can have a rent that is unlinked to that public investment. So that is, I think, one of the main reasons that rent control is a threat to real estate capital, is because it starts to sever this cord and creates a new subjectivity among tenants, who are now pushing for a different kind of urban planning than they might have before, and are also unafraid to organize because they can’t have their lease denied simply because they stood up to their landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 What’s your response to the argument that many economists make, that rent control ends up driving up rent by disincentivizing housing construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’d ask to see where that happened. Rents have gone up in places without rent control. Rents have gone up in non-controlled places that have rent control. What that seems to say is that non rent controlled places see their rents go up. That’s a different proposition than, rent control is the reason why rents are rising. Mainstream economists have all sorts of reasons for disliking rent control but it’s worth saying they don’t like any kind of price control. So rent control is just one form of controlling a good. But, I mean, rents and housing are a different kind of good than many others. Without it you risk losing your life. And so there’s all sorts of different reasons why we should control rents in ways that are different than the price of other goods. In most places, new development is not immediately rent controlled or rent stabilized unless the developer opts into the system. Usually they get a big tax break. That’s how it is in New York. New development is only rent stabilized if the landlord gets a huge tax break to do so. Otherwise, new development is not rent controlled. So there is no restriction on new supply that’s created by rent control. Landlords sometimes say that rent control causes them to disinvest from their buildings because they’re not bringing in enough money. Landlords tend to disinvest from their buildings even when they get the money––they just hold onto it. Rent control often allows landlords to raise rents when they invest in their buildings, so that’s an incentive to invest in the building, not to pull money out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of disingenuous arguments that get made around rent control. It’s not perfect, and it doesn’t actually get us toward decommodifying housing, which is what we really need, but it is a very important immediate step. And I think more and more economists have been coming around to the fact that the free market does not produce affordable housing, which is very helpful for those of us who thought that all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As you mentioned earlier, U.S. homeownership is at, has hit, a 50-year low. 37 percent of all home sales in 2016 nationwide went to absentee investors. Does this crisis in the private, post-World War II system of American homeownership––something that we can also describe as a crisis in in social reproduction under American capitalism––does that present an opportunity to push for a decommodification of housing? And if so, what would that look like in the short, medium, and long-term?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. So housing is a key terrain for struggles around social reproduction, which is the ability of labor to live, on into the future, for people to have the basic needs met. And what we’ve seen in housing, as with healthcare, as with childcare, as with other terrains of social reproduction, more and more of the burden has been put onto labor. More of the cost that used to be borne either by capital, or the state, or both, is expected to be paid out directly by workers, including domestic workers. And so yes, it is a crisis of social reproduction if people simply can’t afford to live anymore. And this is the case in both those hypergentrified areas, and those severely disinvested areas. And so, it could create a crisis for capitalism if the working class simply can’t live anywhere and therefore get to work the next day. And so, you could see capital––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because then there are no workers––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Then there are no workers. Same problem if there was no food. Same problem if, well, we have a healthcare crisis, but we’ve managed it as we have for a long time. But this seems to be moving into crisis dimensions in healthcare. So yes, it’s possible. Unfortunately, capital seems to be willing to let this go on for quite a long time and is only coming up with solutions to the crisis that are productive for real estate capital. So, creating affordable housing as a way of sheltering taxes for luxury housing. Or creating affordable housing as a small component of a much larger luxury development. Those are forms of mediating the crisis that ultimately make the underlying conditions worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In terms of potential solutions, I want to talk a little bit more about public housing and social housing. And the history of that, in short, is that it was by and large built in one post-war moment, and then subjected to segregation, marginalization, stigmatization, and most critically disinvestment. And so, it was government that failed public housing. But then in a classic sleight of hand, public housing was deemed to be a failure. In recent decades a huge number of public housing units have been eliminated, ironically in the name of things like integration and livability. And now, New York is going so far as to privatize open space in public housing to raise funds for public housing. Explain first, the politics and funding structure for public housing, how that fits into your analysis of the roots of the rise and ultimate dominance of real estate capital, and then how we will need to think about public and social housing as key components of the cities of the future that we’re fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Sure. So public housing in this country was largely a response to the Depression. And we’ve gone through many different phases of public housing solving many different problems. It was actually first a mass employment program, more than it was dealing with housing conditions, although it also did that. It then becomes a housing solution, as many many people were foreclosed and evicted during the Depression. There are also different models that got experimented with in the early years. The first public housing is called First Houses. It’s in the Lower East Side. That was where the city acquired tenement housing and turned it into public housing. It wasn’t the sort of demolish and rebuild, tower in the park style, that most of us are used to now. There were also investments in worker-owned cooperatives that were built out by unions, sometimes on open space, sometimes by demolishing even poorer workers’ housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were multiple different experiments going on at once, and we ended up sort of settling with a mode of public housing that was first built through urban renewal––which meant tearing out existing communities of workers––then building up public housing largely not for the people who lived there before, and ensuring that it would be segregated as part of the idea of what made good housing. It is invested in but never enough. And so there is all sorts of shortcuts that get made that make the housing vulnerable to the weather and other things that could have been foreseen. In New York City we put almost all of it along the waterfront, which has made it really prone to flooding, and leaks for example, and mold, and other dangerous conditions. But it was not until the 1970s and especially the 1980s that the federal government just said, we’re not going to pay for this anymore. And the budget for HUD got scaled back and scaled back to a minuscule amount of what it was originally. And so as the federal commitment to it goes down, the city and state has to either pay more or let them rot. And in a lot of cities starting, I believe, in Atlanta, moving on to New Orleans, Chicago, Baltimore, Miami, all sorts of places, public housing is just destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There’s Hope Six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Hope Six––a Clinton era program to demolish public housing and to replace it with mixed income private housing. This was not done in New York City, except in one instance, and just a couple days ago it was in the news that city leaders are thinking about starting to do more of this. But in a lot of places we just tore down the public housing and we replace it with a much smaller amount of low-income housing. So not in any way solving the housing problem, just moving it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And this is all premised on the idea that the problem with public housing is that too many poor people are living together, rather than the fact that public housing has been systematically disinvested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. It blames the the residents for for some reason not paying enough rent, even though a lot of them are paying a greater proportion of their income toward rent than a lot of private housing tenants were. There’s also these kind of strange architectural explanations that get expounded, that tall buildings are bad for people, and no one will take care of their public housing complex if it doesn’t have a clear entryway, and things like this. The same design is used in rich people’s housing all the time, but it’s invested in. Public housing in New York looks exactly the same as Stuyvesant Town, only Stuyvesant Town never went through a period when no one was paying for anything. Which is exactly what happened when the federal government stop paying for public housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Stuyvesant Town is a massive middle class, at least formerly middle-class housing development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. That was built out with subsidies by an insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 A powerful part of your book is how it shows that a lot of the purported solutions to real estate capital’s problems simply reproduce the problems with real estate capital. In particular you critique inclusionary zoning, a model for creating affordable housing pushed by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and many others, that provides developers with things that developers want, like permission to build their buildings taller in exchange for them setting aside some number of units for so-called affordable housing. And proponents claim that inclusionary zoning recaptures value from developers, but in reality, you write that it just transfers more value to those same developers all while creating very little in the way of truly affordable housing. Explain inclusionary zoning in theory and practice, and how it is that it so masterfully avoids confronting the seemingly obvious question of why the state doesn’t just create this value directly for the public through its own public expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Zoning is the rules that cities have about what can be built where, in terms of how big a thing is, and what use type it is: residential, commercial, industrial. So the city can change the rules around zoning, and when it does it often creates enormous value for landholders. If you increase the development capacity on a lot that’s owned by a person from three stories to 20 stories, you’ve created 17 stories more value for whoever owned that land. It’s a windfall profit. And so, the idea with inclusionary zoning, in theory, is we’re going to undo the old patterns of segregation by saying that new development has to have some affordable housing in it. As practiced in many places, not all but many places, it only takes place in an upzoning, when you’re increasing the development capacity, and it tends to take place––and in New York has almost only taken place––in poor neighborhoods, where the value of land is relatively low. And so, they go to places where the value of land is relatively low, they massively upzone it, and so they create tremendous value for whoever owned that land, and they say, a small portion of this is going to have to be affordable. It’s not that small; 30 percent is the average at this point in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But how affordable is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But it’s not very affordable. It’s certainly not affordable to the people who live in those neighborhoods. Sometimes it’s not even affordable to anybody in the city. It’s actually market rate, but it gets coded as affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And they come up with that value of what counts as affordable by measuring it on the metropolitan level, which is incredibly ironic given the way that segregation between municipalities operates on the metropolitan level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So it’s not what’s affordable in the neighborhood that’s being rezoned. It’s not what’s affordable in the city. It’s what’s affordable in the city plus the surrounding suburbs. But that wouldn’t even be a problem if we said, okay, so that artificially high calculation, which is demanded by the federal government, we’re going to subvert that by saying new housing should be a really low percentage of that median income. Right? So if we said, new housing will be for people making 20 percent of that median income, we would undercut that regressive federal standard. But that’s not the way it is. In some of this affordable housing you can make one hundred and fifteen percent of that area median income and have it still be coded as affordable, even though it is more expensive than asking rents in that neighborhood. And so, the affordable housing isn’t affordable, but even if it was, it is tagged along to a huge amount of luxury development in places that are at risk of gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t do inclusionary zoning in those exclusionary areas that I talked about before, that are predominantly white, that are upper income, that are low density, and yet high transit accessible. Those places exist in New York City; they exist in many other places. They are not the targets of inclusionary zoning. Instead it’s places like East New York, which is one of the poorest places in New York City, which is one of the only places where the African American population increased during the Bloomberg era. That’s the place that gets this inclusionary upzoning. And so yeah, it’s a perfect way of making a new market in places that capital has abandoned or has not yet figured out the business model. It’s not a solution to the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And politically legitimating the gentrification of a neighborhood like East New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. It’s considered progress; it’s success. And as we talked about before, it’s coded as desegregation even though it’s really gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Speaking of things that are considered progress but are not, we should talk a little bit more about Bill de Blasio. Because, understanding what has become of his administration I think is really critical for the Left everywhere, not just in New York right now. In 2013 he ran this ‘tale of two cities’ campaign that rightly demonized Michael Bloomberg as governing solely on behalf of the super rich. But, ultimately, you write, both de Blasio and Bloomberg, “subscribe to the same planning paradigm. Whatever the problem the solution is luxury developments.” There are no doubt important differences between the two mayors, including some recent protections put in place for people facing eviction. But, that something so important is shared by two politicians that appear to be, and present themselves as, so different reveals that there is, you write, “something much bigger than the figure at the top of the political pyramid.” Explain your analysis here, both concretely in the case of how real estate capital has operated so similarly in New York under two so purportedly different mayors, and then also if you could step back and just more generally, I think this is a really good case study of how Marxist analysis can provide a powerful tool to look underneath the noisy surface of politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There is so much noise there. Their styles are dramatically different. Physical appearances are somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 De Blasio is very tall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 He is a very tall man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Bloomberg’s a short guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s right. And a lot gets made of that for arbitrary reasons. And, they can do a lot of different things. So, if what you’re looking at is their relation to charter schools, for example, they have a very different approach. When you look at planning and real estate, however, it’s remarkably similar but discussed as if it were different. So, both of them are premising their development strategies on upzoning working class neighborhoods of color. That’s not just the way to expand the housing stock and to create this inclusionary housing, it’s also the way that they fund transit. It’s the way that they promote the arts. It’s the way that they will fund NYCHA, the public housing agency authority. It’s the way that they will desegregate neighborhoods. It’s the way they will fix the education system. It’s always a big part of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the problem, the solution is luxury development. It gets talked about differently. So, Bloomberg would say, this city is a luxury product and that’s a quote. He said, we are not Walmart, we are selling ourselves at a very high level. And only the best and the brightest will come here––by best and the brightest he means the richest––will come here, and afford it, and enjoy it, and they will pay their taxes, and we will use that money toward everybody’s benefit. And the irony is, he attracts all these rich people through tax cuts. You can’t attract rich people with tax cuts and then expect those taxes to then support social services. But he wasn’t hiding the fact that he was trying to create a luxury city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Blasio was doing many of the same things as if that was a progressive agenda. As if this would create more stability in the housing market for working class people, as if this would address the fundamental inequalities of the city. So, the actions are the same, but the description is quite different. The mode of political journalism can often get caught up in the story of the day; the soundbite and the mayor’s press release that presents a certain spin on these developments. It is helpful, then, to have Marxist analysis that will show the continuity within capitalist government regimes while also noting the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because it’s often the quiet parts, the points of agreement, that matter the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right they don’t have to say the fundamental assumptions that govern both models. Those are fundamental assumptions––that’s the point of assumptions is you don’t have to say them. So that allows a huge amount of continuity to go unnoticed. And whenever there is an election then, we just assume that most of the things will remain the same, and we debate where there’s flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Though it’s pretty hilarious when the De Blasio Administration is pushed on what some of these assumptions are. This is a quote from Alicia Glen, who was, until I think pretty recently, de Blasio’s Deputy Mayor for Housing and Economic Development and prior to that was an executive at Goldman Sachs. She told 
Vice, “we have certain tools in our municipal toolbox. We can’t change the entire history of capitalism and we’re not Trotsky. You try to redistribute some of that growth to the people that need it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. So, she was helpful in that she was unusually frank. She would say exactly what their assumption is, which is we’re not going to change the fundamentals, and we’re going to create a whole bunch of wealth and we’re going to redistribute some of it. That’s what she says in that quote. In another quote in the same interview she says, people just hate change. And so that’s why they’re all mad at us, because they don’t like change. I don’t like change. Like when my dry cleaner goes out of business and is replaced by a new dry cleaner. “It pisses me off,” is what she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That’s really strong feelings about having to use a new dry cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. It’s either really strong feelings about her dry cleaner or a mass underestimate of the anger that people were feeling towards their planning and rezoning regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And a naturalization of the particular type of change that is happening with gentrification as just sort of the normal change that places always inevitably experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. And this is the irony, is that they can say we are changing the city. By rezoning, by encouraging development, by bringing in real estate capital, by ultimately creating gentrification as the solution to gentrification. They say, that’s change, and people don’t like change, so they’re just against it because they’re reactionary. People on the ground are calling for stability. Whether that’s in the form of tenant protections or commercial rent control or other things. It’s true––they are arguing against a form of change, but that in and of itself is change. Going on the the existing path gets us toward that gentrification and that promotion of real estate strategies. It would take a massive political change to create the stability that people are craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One huge debate raging all across the country, I think most fiercely in San Francisco, is over how much to build and where to build it. And there a group of people called “YIMBYs,” which stands for Yes In My BackYard, who argue that restrictions on development are what is driving up rent, by restricting supply. And the only solution, they say, is to get the government out of the way so that developers can build as much as they can at all price levels. Explain the YIMBYs and your argument about what they get wrong about how supply, demand, and price work under the real estate state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So this is a growing movement coming out of San Francisco and Boston. We’re now seeing it in New York a bit more, though it hasn’t really taken hold. And their argument is, the problem is a constraint on supply. And they use this kind of economics 101 argument that the supply is too small, so if we increase the supply, the demand will go down, and fundamentally the price will follow. I think the most offensive thing about their argument is an unwillingness to distinguish between different types of housing, different types of development in different places. So, a core principle of this YIMBY movement is we need more of all types of housing. Which is fine, except developers are only building to the top of the market, unless there’s some sort of regulation that forces them to do something else, or some other sort of incentive structure, which most of the YIMBYs consider to be an impingement on the market rather than a way to increase––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But they believe it doesn’t matter because it’s one market, in their view, and the units filter down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right. They believe in a unified rental market. But this filtering never happens. Housing built for very rich people does not become housing for very poor people. There are multiple markets at play at the same time. Creating new luxury housing may––at enormous quantities––may affect the price of luxury housing. It will not filter down to the rest of us. That assumes that everyone would move all the time to maximize their market equilibrium; that we would move to find the place that has the vacant apartment that is exactly my perfect capacity to pay rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Sounds like a very pleasant way to go about one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s impossible. I mean, it’s unpleasant, it’s anti-social. It assumes that nobody cares about anybody else in their neighborhood, or their family, or their institutions, or their school district, or anything else. That people will just pick up and move to the next place. That people have the money to pick up and move. Moving takes money. It’s expensive. This model assumes a perfect economic market in which everyone has perfect information about what is available when. It assumes, like I said before, that raising the supply of luxury housing will somehow filter out to the rest of us. It doesn’t take into account the relational aspects of real estate, i.e. that if a big, expensive luxury tower goes up next to a tenement, the tenement renters are going to pay more in rent, not less, because they are next to the big fancy building. it’s a model that sometimes has been using the language of racial equality, and correctly bringing up the racist history of zoning laws, to make the argument that the government should simply get out of the practice of regulating development. Which I would argue will produce far more racially disparate impacts than a well thought out regulatory system. Or not well thought out, an anti-racist regulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’d like you to chart out the short, medium, and long-term tasks of the Left at the city, state, federal, global level to fight real estate capital and place land planning under democratic, popular control, both from a left governance perspective and from a grassroots organizing one. And in addition, how we should think about that fight to democratize control over land in terms of our thinking about how we’re going to confront climate change, because we’re going to need to reorganize the spaces that we live in big time to avoid total catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to do that because one person shouldn’t answer that much for the Left at the local to global level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It can be local then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’ll give you a mix. But this is something I struggled with at the end of my book, is you spend four chapters explaining how we got this way and then you’re expected to give a solution at the end, and it can come off as very arrogant, to say I know what we should all be doing. And so, I don’t want to go there. I do, however, then chart out at the end of the book what could be done right now within the system as it currently exists. Things that aren’t against the rules of republican government or the capitalist mode of production, that would actually address some of these dynamics of the real estate state. And I do this not because I expect planners and mayors to read this and say like, oh yeah, we should be doing that, but to show people that this is not the only way that it could have turned out. That there are other ways of doing things, even within the restrictions that we have, that would produce different results. And so, an example of that is like, with inclusionary zoning, which I don’t think is a great tool, which is classic neoliberalism because it expects the developers to fix the problem that the developers created, rather than the state or any other social function. But if we only did inclusionary development in exclusionary places, and we then transferred all the protections that are in exclusionary places into places that are vulnerable to gentrification, we would produce a very different result. If we taxed at a very high rate luxury vacant apartments, we would change the market calculus that currently incentivizes building out endlessly tall luxury buildings with the assumption that someone will buy it as an investment property to sell it to someone else as an investment property to sell it to someone else as an investment property. Severely taxing those places would change those dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have many things in cities that could be expanded. For example, we have limited rent control in many places that could be universal. We have community land trusts in small areas of cities that could be expanded to cover much larger areas. These things already exist and should be, ought to be expanded. We have a political economy that is dominated by real estate but is not exclusively real estate. There are other economic actors, and we could be working to rediversify some of our urban economies to bring back those contradictions we talked about earlier. Not because that was an excellent moment in the history of labor, but it certainly produced a better set of possibilities than what we have right now. All those things are things that we can be pushing for in the immediate short-term. I think the way that we actually get anything bigger is through housing movements, and specifically tenant movements, in cities. So we’ve kind of given up on a lot of that and focused mostly on development, and that’s where the YIMBY argument starts to make sense––that if the problem and the solution is development, then we should change our zoning codes and we can recorrect the market for housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;moremoreBut if we first problematize the fact that there is a market for housing, and that all of us pay rent to landlords regardless of whether the landlord needs that money to reinvest in the building––it’s simply a de facto thing that you have to do every month or you lose your right to housing––if we politicize all of that I think we can build a stronger movement than the one we have right now, which fights really hard over new development for and against. And I am very involved in those struggles because they are immediately very important. But I would like to move beyond them to be struggling more generally around housing and tenancy as a condition. The same goes for public housing. We are sort of fighting to protect what we have, which is a very battered-down public housing stock that needs great investment. But we could also be expanding, acting to change the law that restricts us from expanding public housing as it exists, either through new construction or the original mode of public housing, which was acquiring buildings. Even de Blasio has threatened to do this. He has now done it in a couple of cases and immediately transferred them over to a nonprofit. It’s better than nothing, but we could be acquiring much more housing and taking it out of the private landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In terms of overton window shifting on housing, it seems like it could be useful if a certain presidential candidate decided to politicize housing as a national issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That would be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I don’t think it’s been part of the debate yet has it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Not really. I mean Elizabeth Warren has a housing bill which is basically, let’s do more of what we used to do, which is good––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In terms of public housing funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, but mostly a housing trust fund that would go to nonprofits to develop low-income housing, tax credit-funded development. All of that is better than what we’re doing right now, but it’s not really a bold new program it’s like, let’s stop the bleeding. I want to stop the bleeding, but I want to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So what would be the paradigm shifting Medicare-for-all style proposal on the national level on housing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’m going put in a pitch for the next issue of Jacobin which is all about housing and covers a lot of these issues, and I believe there is a Dear Bernie letter in there which will get at a lot of this. We should remember that rent control is originally a federal price control that was put into place in wartime. So, it’s become a municipal issue, maybe a state issue, but it was originally a federal issue. And that’s my first idea. That and stop defunding public housing. It doesn’t have to be public housing for all, but public housing for anyone could be the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, Samuel Stein, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is gentrification? It isn’t just about what was once known as the hipster and is still known as the artist, the telltale warning signs of impending demographic change. It’s part of an entire political-economic order that has made real estate global capitalism’s most prized asset for storing wealth—one that has helped bend place-based urban governments to the will of mobile, and thus more powerful, capital. Dan interviews Samuel Stein on his book,

&lt;p&gt;Cuando se piensa en Chile desde el extranjero, generalmente surge la imagen de su pasado reciente marcado por la dictadura cívico–militar. Y esto con toda razón. El legado del régimen genocida de Pinochet todavía está presente en todas partes—en la memoria personal y colectiva, en las leyes y en una constitución profundamente neoliberal que sigue condenando al sistema político a un bipartidismo e impide las transformaciones deseadas por la soberanía popular. Daniel Jadue, el alcalde de la comuna de Recoleta, ubicada en la Región Metropolitana del Gran Santiago, se ha entregado a la empresa de construir en su territorio un laboratorio del comunismo del presente y del futuro. Junto a su equipo ha abierto una farmacia popular, una óptica popular y una linda librería popular. Todos estos servicios de primera necesidad venden sus productos a precios bajos y justos desafiando con ello a un mercado supuestamente autoregulado que en Chile sólo ha demostrado funcionar más bien estimulando prácticas de monopolio—un capitalismo salvaje.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si nos estas escuchando hoy por primera vez con este episodio especial en español y también hablas inglés, por favor revisa nuestro archivo que contiene muchísimas entrevistas con intelectuales y activistas de la izquierda: blubrry.com/thedig/&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2019-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/transcripts/transcript-un-laboratorio-del-socialismo-en-chile-entrevista-con-daniel-jadue</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/un-laboratorio-del-socialismo-en-chile-entrevista-con-daniel-jadue/&quot;&gt;Listen to Episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When most outsiders think of Chile, the first thing that comes to mind are of the scars left by the civilian-military dictatorship. And with good reason: The legacy of Pinochet’s genocidal regime is everywhere — in personal and collective memories, in the country’s privatized institutions like education, and in its profoundly neoliberal constitution, which keeps the Chilean political system shackled to its brutal past and makes left politics exceedingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the legacy of the revolution led by the supporters of Salvador Allende’s socialist government endures, too. Despite opposition from a broad sector of anti-constitutional military leaders and the Chilean oligarchy, popular resistance never died out or gave in — even in the face of the intervention by US president Richard Nixon’s government, which played a key role in the military coup of September 11, 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Denvir interviewed Daniel Jadue, the mayor of Recoleta, a district located in the Metropolitan Region of Greater Santiago, for the Dig (you can listen to the full-length Spanish-language episode here). Jadue’s administration is building a laboratory for communism of today and of the future, opening a people’s pharmacy and optometrist, along with a beautiful people’s bookstore. Just before this interview was published, Recoleta announced the opening of a people’s record store. All these essential services are provided at low prices, confronting a free market that supposedly self-regulates but which in Chile has only demonstrated how an unregulated market fosters a savage and untamed capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jadue is a militant in the Communist Party of Chile and one of the most important figures on the Latin American left. We all have a lot to learn from what is happening in Recoleta, especially since one of the most persistent criticisms of actually existing socialisms has been their supposed administrative failures; their inefficiency in actually serving “the people.” With his successful measures, Jadue defies not just the historical stereotypes and realities but the entire neoliberal order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this conversation, Dan talks about the fight in his district and the current political situation in Chile more broadly, including the role of the student movements, the conflict between the Chilean state and the Mapuche people, the powerful feminist movement, the defeat of the center-left New Majority coalition in 2017, the weighty legacy of Pinochet, the current conservative government of Sebastián Piñera, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The US has played a major role in fomenting violence across Yemen, backing the Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led forces attacking the country while also conducting a direct war against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula under the guise of counterterrorism. But while it’s understandable that US involvement is the top focus for the American left, understanding the war in Yemen requires a much broader analysis. The Yemeni conflict not only includes multiple outside actors but also multiple groups of Yemenis pursuing different outcomes, rooted in a complex history that few outside of Yemen understand. Explaining that context is what this show, in partnership with the Middle East Research and Information Project (MERIP), is all about. This special episode includes two interviews with contributors to Middle East Report, MERIP’s print publication. First, up is Yemeni journalist Afrah Nasser and political scientist Stacey Philbrick Yadav; and then, Dan speaks with political-economist Adam Hanieh.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the US, China is often viewed at best as a nefarious and enigmatic rival and at worst as a civilizational enemy. But these stories of national rivalry that permeate both major parties and the mainstream media function as a mystification, shrouding the global supply chain that connects capitalist exploitation from East to West. When we cut through the noise, a rather different picture emerges: China is home to a massive portion of the world’s working-class, a class that is struggling against the combined forces of state and global capital for dignified lives. And these struggles, contrary to conventional wisdom, are deeply connected, rather than opposed to, worker struggles in the West. Dan interviews sociologist Jenny Chan on China’s class conflict and labor movement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The strike is back, and big time. Teachers in particular have been walking off the job not only to demand higher wages but also to fight for an end to privatization and for a transformation of the educational system for their students. These strikes, often led by women, are no doubt inspiring, and they have won important victories for workers and the communities they serve. We are, in other words, beginning to head in the right direction—but we’re not heading there even close to fast enough. Winning working class power is not only necessary to meet people’s immediate material needs. It is necessary if we are to accomplish a profound democratization of this country, which is what we must do if we are to implement a just energy transition that heads off what scientists have determined to be imminent climate catastrophe.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;American liberty has since its foundation relied upon the dispossession of indigenous people and Mexicans, upon African enslavement and, ultimately, upon the constant fleeing outward that created an empire that none dare call by its name. As historian Greg Grandin writes in 
, this expansionist project has finally lost its ideological and material vitality, no longer able to neatly reconcile centuries of mounting contradictions. And so politics returned to the border as American expansion hit a wall—figuratively and, as Trump has demanded, very literally. “Trumpism,” Grandin writes, “is extremism turned inward, all-consuming and self-devouring. There is no ‘divine, messianic’ crusade that can harness and redirect passions outward. Expansion, in any form, can no longer satisfy interests, reconcile contradictions, dilute the factions, or redirect the anger.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mohammad-Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou explains: it’s not just that the War on Terror has warped American and European politics and society; it’s that the War on Terror and Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS have become mutually-critical facets of a larger, more total global geo-political order. In other words, the terrorists and the national security states waging war against them are dependent upon one another, and together have created a more violent, divided and alienated world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feminism for the 99%: A Manifesto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sentinels of Culture: Class, Education, and the Colonial Intellectual in Bengal,Social Reproduction Theory: Remapping Class, Recentering OppressionFeminism for the 99%: A Manifesto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Tithi Bhattacharya, Welcome to The Dig. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tithi Bhattacharya:Thank you, Daniel. It’s great to be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Let’s start with what’s happening right now and why it’s happening right now, before we get to your manifesto’s argument about what we should do about it. You write that there is “a crisis of society as a whole: simultaneously a crisis of economy, of ecology, of politics, and of care.” Explain your general argument about how it is that capitalism depends on more than economics narrowly construed, including the subordination of women through the expropriation of social reproductive labor––how all of these relationships of expropriation, to labor exploitation, dependent but denied, deepen these multiple sites of contradiction and as a result have pushed us into this general crisis you’re writing about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:We understand Marxism, or Capital Volume 1anyway, to be about exploitation and the extraction of profit and surplus value. Not just Marxists, but many people, understand that as the explanation for capitalism. So in this understanding, the extraction of surplus value or profit is done through the economic motor that makes workers either work longer hours or work more in order to make profit for the boss. So this is considered the motor of capitalism. But there are several places in Marx, for instance in “The German Ideology,” where Marx and Engels are basically saying that all of this happens in order for the worker to live, because at some point, that is, at the inception of the system, the worker had to be separated from her means of living––and that was a violent process. So there we have a story of colonialism as the beginnings of capitalism, or the conditions of possibility for capitalism. So if we all had access to reproducing our lives, then we wouldn’t have to work for our bosses. No one is going to go to a horrible 9 to 5 job, or increasingly, many more hours than 9 to 5, if we had access to making our own food, leading our own lives. So that separation of the working class, or the violent tearing away of the working class from her means of production, of herself and her life, is why the worker is dependent on the capitalist to reproduce her life. So becoming wage slaves for capital is not a natural thing. We have to be made into it, so certain capacities are actually emphasized or deemphasized by capitalist social relations in order for us to become workers. And in this expansive understanding of life-making and profit-making, we often forget, even Marxists often forget, that people go to work in order to live. The wage form actually intervenes between the human being and her life-making, and this is why workers fight for the wage, because it is not for the wage itself that she is fighting but it is for what the wage can achieve, which is life. And this is a very important understanding of wage labor that I think many Marxists, class reductionists, and definitely the bosses of unions forget––that the worker is not struggling for the wage per say, but she is struggling for the life that the wage can afford. So when conditions of life worsen for working class people, struggle erupts. So this is the larger theoretical understanding behind our theory of crisis that we advance in the book, that the current capitalist crisis actually threatens life as we know it. So if you look at climate change as one of the forms in which the crisis manifests itself, Andreas Malm has argued that if we have any policy that does not acknowledge, that if we don’t deal with climate change urgently and immediately, it’s basically genocide. So any government that does not support substantive measures for dealing with climate change, not just dealing but actually trying to stop and regulate climate change, then they are basically saying yes to mass genocide. And from our perspective as well, 80 percent of climate refugees are women. So this is an ecological crisis. We are confronted with the question whether life-making is even possible for our grandchildren, whether social reproduction is even possible for our grandchildren. Then there’s the crisis of politics itself. Again, bourgeois understandings of politics train us to think that we have control over political life through the trappings of bourgeois democracy, which is, you know, we go to vote once every four years. So there is a very direct and discreet separation between control over social life that we’ve been talking about, and political life. And I think this crisis is that while vast swaths of the globe feel that they have the right “to vote,” actually this right obscures the fact that neoliberalism has steadily basically denuded our control over social life. So a part of the answer to the political crisis, as we have talked about in the book, is that we seek control back over our social life. So it’s not just suffrage that we want extended. We actually want more control over how we lead our lives. The third crisis that we outline on top of all this is the crisis of social reproduction. And here I think we have to look at the concept of care in a more political sense than we normally understand care to be. We understand care to be sort of individual care that individual caregivers give to the vulnerable and the needy in our society. But I think under neoliberalism, what has happened is––again, because it actually attacked the infrastructure of life-making, so it attacked the very elements that we need to reproduce our lives: hospitals to heal us, schools to educate us, public parks that provide us with green spaces, and not to mention, public transportation…all of these basic infrastructures that make life-making possible were taken away, devastated, or just canceled by neoliberalism. So in this barren landscape of this virulent attack on these institutions of caregiving, not just the idea of care but the institutions of caregiving, care then emerges as a political practice, I want to say. So every teacher who’s fighting against school closures, every nurse that is fighting against lean production, is actually, in their real work, trying to heal the injuries of class. So in that context, care is a political phenomenon and the crisis of care is beyond just the denudation of these public infrastructures. It is actually a much more deep-rooted attack on working class life-making, and this is why to regain control, we must understand care and caregiving as a politicized phenomenon. And this is why we should not be surprised that the majority of struggles are erupting in the current context over the battle over these infrastructures of care. So battle over clean air, clean water, public schools, public parkways, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Explain how it is that capitalism makes this division between the backstage of expropriation, including in social reproduction, and the front stage that we most often associate with Marxist analysis, of exploitation––a relationship that, under capitalism, is dependent but then denied and obscured, including to many on the left. And explain how that all deepens these various sites of contradiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;actually mean by capitalist production. Capitalist production is not just the production of commodities through which profit is made by the expropriation of surplus value, of workers. Capitalist production also requires two other things: one, the social reproduction of itself. Capital must have stable, dependent social relations that it can rely on to carry on that production. It actually needs a pliant workforce, preferably divided by all kinds of race, gender, and sexuality-oriented divisions. And so those social relations are what capital relies on for its continued existence. But we have to think also that capitalism produces commodities––that’s the source of its life. But somebody has to produce those commodities in order for capitalist profits to be realized, and those somebodies are actually the working class. And so the system also needs a reliable mechanism for the reproduction of the working class and the reproduction of the class’s labor power, which is what it needs. So those two circuits––the reproduction of labor power, which I call people-making, if you like, or life-making, and the production of commodities, or profits––are actually united circuits. Both go into the maintenance of the system. If one were to collapse then the other would collapse as well. For instance, in the early days of industrial capitalism, Engels’s book,, shows that at the early beginnings, as the system was getting set up, capitalism had no idea that there could be some limits to its greed. So it basically ate up all the labor palette that it found available, which is men, women, children, everyone. So there are devastating descriptions of working-class homes in Engels’s book, which I think should be a companion towhere working women, children, are found dead on floors of one room where six or seven of them live with no toilet facilities and so on. So that was an actual threat of interruption to working class life-making, which is why the capitalist state had to step in and say “okay, we cannot kill the golden goose,” so we have to regulate working hours and we have to regulate certain things, which is, not surprisingly, when laws were passed to strengthen, actually, the working-class family. So laws were passed to send working-class women back from the workplace into the home where they could carry on these so-called care activities, and the male breadwinner emerged, ultimately, as the––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And this was the political economy of Victorian morality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Correct. Exactly. And so it was never, ever true that working-class women mainly stayed at home. I mean, look at the lives of Black women in the United States. But the discourse was created that housework was women’s work. So actually, in the case of women of color throughout history, and working-class women in general, it is now that they had to work these long hours in the factories in order to make life-making possible, but then they also had to do all the homemaking in the house, and childrearing and so on. So this is the relationship between life and production that capitalism actually obscures. This is the root of what I said before, of the separation between economic and political life with social life. So like capitalism naturalizes all social relations, the family is seen or declared by capitalism as a transhistorical unit, where women have always given birth, and isn’t it natural to imagine that they always will? So this is basically the root of gender oppression: the bourgeois family. This is not to say that there was no gender oppression previous to capitalism, but this is the specific form that gender oppression takes under capitalism, which is why the effort of revolutionaries and socialists and feminists have always been to evacuate the house of all social reproductive functions, so communal laundries, communal kitchens, and so on…That society as a collective will assist in the work of reproduction, which would be far more efficient than an individual family doing it. If you think about the concept of public kitchens, we should realize that they actually exist. They’re called restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Only that the rich can afford them, right? We are just merely saying that there should be a public restaurant in every neighborhood where each neighborhood member…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:It seems like such a radical proposal, but in fact there’s a lot of evidence that people quite like and desire public kitchens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Right, exactly! This would be an effective way to change out the McDonald’s diet into a healthy, neighborhood, local public kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And decommodify it all at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TB:&lt;/strong&gt;
Correct. This has been the effort since the start of the 20th century, you know, the Bolsheviks being, Kollontai particularly, being an early advocate for this. But in a way, wages for housework is not the same thing, but it is still identifying in a way the same problem, that housework is the problem and we need to abolish it in some way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:An important argument that you make, that I hadn’t really connected to social reproduction theory before, is that capitalism not only hijacked social reproduction to feed and clothe workers and what not, so as to prepare them for workplace exploitation, but under capitalism, care work is also used by the powers that be, and the system, that is, to craft people into a certain type of subject––nationalist, cis, heterosexual, obedient to authority in and out of the workplace, and of course, accepting of their station in life. Explain this social control function of social reproduction under capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Okay, so now let’s think about the modern school system. I do Indian history––I was trained in South Asian history. So all precapitalist education systems were yes, gender, and in my case, because I do South Asia, caste based, but none of these education systems had hourly routines. You didn’t go to school at a certain time in the morning, stay there for a certain time, your time being divided into periods. This is a very, very 19th century addition to when modern schools are coming into being. And what is that timing? It is the discipline of the workplace, that you are being taught early. My kid struggles to get up sometimes at 5:30 in order to make her orchestra class before school, but that discipline she is learning right now, so that it prepares her for when she’s going to be a worker. So the very existence of these kind of temporal rhythms that we encounter very early in school are efforts to make us into compliant beings for capital. I always ask my class this question: when you were a child, you know, between the ages of, let’s say, three and five or six, who taught you to love your parents? Like did you have anthems at home that said you must love your parents, or whoever the caregivers might be, that you should love your guardians? Was there anything? Like was there a script you followed? And they said no. I said, “why not?” They said, “because they were there and they cared for us and so we loved them back.” I said “okay, then if the nation is such a stable identity that we all believe in its existence, that it’s there for us, to protect us against our enemies, then you shouldn’t need a Pledge of Allegiance, you shouldn’t need a national anthem to basically train you that the nation is great and glorious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Ronald Reagan cradling me as a small child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Exactly. And then they get the whole point, that you don’t love the nation as a natural biological response to the nation loving you, but you have to be taught to love the nation. And in America it’s particularly, I think, early and severe, this indoctrination, because it starts at age five. From age five, without understanding even the words, children are taught to parrot the Pledge of Allegiance. And so those are capital’s mechanisms. Two of the most sort of common ones that I told you, which are related to when we are children, as to how it creates people who they will find useful for profit-making purposes. We are trained as humans to be servants to the profit-making impulse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And then the gender conditioning is everywhere and pretty obvious and has reached its apotheosis in the explosion of “gender reveal parties.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Exactly. Actually, how do we know that a baby, a fetus who has exhibited a penis, is actually gendered male? I mean, all we can say is “we are going to show you what the genitalia is of the baby.” How can it be gender? So it should be called genitalia parties, rather than gender parties. So there is that. But I want to say that this all sounds very Foucauldian, and we are sort of prisoners in this system, but I think there is a huge caveat to that when it comes to relations of social reproduction. It’s important to remember that while the circuits, which I talked about before, the circuit of commodity production and the circuit of life-making, while they’re united, they’re also separate. They’re united but separate. Capital has direct control over the profit-making circuit. It can actually tell the worker what to do. Over the circuit of life-making it only has indirect control. So this is not to say “we can all be what we want to be” and so on. Our decisions that we make in the social reproduction sphere are suffused by the silent compulsions of the wage labor relation. That is certainly true but it is not complete. So people do not actually have pleasure in each other or have sex with each other with the acute thought that “I must make a generation of workers for capital.” So there is a genuinely human––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Maybe that’s a small number of people’s very particular fetish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Okay, I’m allowing for that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You never know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Yeah, please don’t ever tell me what their bedroom talk is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:We won’t yuck their yum. But go ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:So people actually, in this sphere, have a limited but important ability to express, and perhaps shape, real human relations. This is very different from the workplace condition where there is no mercy at all. We say now there is gender fluidity in our society. But actually, if you look back in any decent history of queer struggles, we can see that there was gender fluidity throughout history. So despite what capital wants in its heteronormative narrative, people have always done what they thought was important to them in terms of their sexuality. Now of course, the vast majority of people could not. So some of these legal rights that we have gained in our generation, extremely important, to allow people to come out more openly, but that is not to deny that these relations of human love and human beauty were completely suppressed by capitalism. Then we would just be living in some kind of automaton world. And we don’t, human beings still love, create beauty, and so on. Despite capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:There’s always this point of conflict here. What Nancy Fraser calls “boundary struggles,” if I remember correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Correct. My interpretation of that boundary struggle is to add one more point to it, which is…Nancy is absolutely right that the struggle is over extending our powers of life-making, and making our right to life-making as the key determinant of our struggle, that it’s not just about wages and benefits. What good is a wage or a benefit if you’re going to be arrested by ICE after your major union victory? What is the point of a bread and butter struggle if you are shot down on your way to school? Who’s going to eat that bread? So Nancy’s absolutely right in pointing to that boundary struggle. But I want to say also, that what I said about us having some relative autonomy, some relative autonomy in our life-making sphere…we should never forget that the horizons of that sphere are always limited by capitalism. So I want to imagine a world where that horizon extends to infinity, and then I want to see what humanity is capable of––in their gender relations, in their human relations––because if we think this is gender fluidity, I think we are only seeing the tip of that immense iceberg that has a potential to lift humanity up to heights that we deserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Is this in part, I wonder, Althusser’s argument about ideological state apparatuses but read through a feminist, and thus more substantive, lens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Yes, you could say that I would say that. I would say that in Althusser, I think there is a…between the great debate in Marxism between structure and agency, in Althusser there is an overt dependence on structure. And so I think this way to look at social relations, through both the agency of human beings and the limits of the structure, which is a dialectical relationship between structure and agency that is encapsulated by Marx’s famous words that we make history, but not according to circumstances of our choosing. But we cannot emphasize the circumstances that we don’t choose. We also have to emphasize that we do make history despite those circumstances. So I think that’s the way I would see the relationship between work and class struggle, which is a multiracial, multigendered working class, and the limits put on working class struggle by both capital and traditional understandings of labor struggles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Let’s talk more about these struggles and conflicts. You write that “social reproduction struggles are especially explosive today.” Why is that and particularly, why is this more the case today than during prior moments of capitalist crisis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Well, think about how neoliberalism came into being. If we look at the period of its birth, from the late 1970s after the major struggles recede, and the early 1980s, we can actually track the crucial moments that were necessary for its victory. And some of those crucial moments can be tracked through the spectacular defeats of some major strikes. So I want to think about the textile strike in India, the miners’ strike in the UK, PATCO, the air traffic controllers strike in the US, and, of course, the violent installation of US-backed dictators in various places in Latin America, including where you are right now. But here’s the thing that happened, I think, as a result of that, that neoliberalism sought to break union power in all of these major ways across the Global South and North, which means the working class was actually rendered powerless in the arena of workplaces; at the point of production, neoliberalism sought to take away all its traditional weapons of fight back. And so when that power is broken, then those who basically backed that move said that the working class is finished, and those traditional, I would say, Marxists and so on, said “okay, we need to focus on rebuilding the union movement because that’s where our greatest strength lies and that’s where the working class will recover.” But neither of those two happy things happened. Neither did we rebuild unions nor did the working class recede, because life conditions got so severe that the working class actually started protesting in the best way that it could, which was no longer in the workplace but actually in their life-place, so in communities, on the streets. If you look at the struggles that erupted from the 90s onwards––the water struggles in Bolivia, Cochabamba, the water tax struggles in Ireland, the struggles against big dams in India, evictions everywhere, against housing prices and so on…did not start in the workplace. They started while strike levels were pretty low. Community struggles were pretty high. This is the period of the building of the Palestine movement, the BDS movement, the building of the Black Lives Matter movement. So all of these important social movements came into being in the aftermath of unions losing power. And so again, the traditional understanding has been that when unions build power we will build social power. But actually, I think social reproduction theory teaches us that while we are powerful in the workplace for obvious reasons of collective power to shut down capital, it is not necessary that the spark to that struggle will come from the workplace. So actually, this radical change of consciousness through these social movements can actually affect workers and their confidence to strike in the workplace. And please, let’s remember that the key areas of strikes in workplaces recently have not just been on wages but it has been on benefits as well, which is a very clear indicator of workers fighting for their life conditions, rather than necessarily for their job conditions––which they are as well. And I also noticed that, for instance in the teachers strikes, this time around…so I was in West Virginia, in Kentucky, I’ve talked to teachers from Arizona and so on. Last year there was not, except amongst teachers of color, there wasn’t a clear race component––anti-racist component––to the strikes. I spoke to some brilliant teachers of color in in Kentucky, Louisville, and they basically told me, “well, how can I teach if my student comes traumatized from their experience or their family’s experience with the police on the street?” So there was this consciousness, but mainly amongst teachers of color and some other teachers who stood in solidarity with the teachers of color. What didn’t happen last year was actually that consciousness pervade the strike movement. But look at the Los Angeles teachers’ strike. Race became a very important element of that strike––or anti-racism, rather. And they actually included anti-racist elements in their strike demands. So here we see a sort of advanced layer of teachers, the teachers of color, who came into the strike movement last year having been politicized through BLM are now actually having an effect on the strike movement to adopt certain demands that BLM has taught us. I think again, we have to look at this movement and dynamism between workplace struggle and social struggles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:That brings up something I wanted to ask you about, which is something I’ve been thinking about in terms of the teachers’ movement and their fight against neoliberal education reform and austerity. How should we think of the struggle in the context of public education’s traditional role in making certain types of docile economic and political subjects, which we discussed earlier? This is an aspect of public education that neoliberal privatizers have cynically exploited, presenting themselves as less rigid models, even though they often go on to double down on things like high stakes standardized testing. Do you see the current teacher movement as not only defending public education as it has existed but also fighting to transform it so that it is not a tool of social control? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Absolutely the second. Because I think if you look at it, the neoliberal tools of social control have had a devastating effect not just on the fate of the students, i.e. make them compliant or what have you––which it hasn’t succeeded, obviously, in making the students compliant––but it has had a devastating effect on those who are forced to deliver those tools. Which is our teachers. So when you have standardized tests and standardized tests being the only mechanism to judge your teachers, then there is no joy in teaching. You can’t actually control any conditions of your work and you are constantly at risk of being fired because you haven’t met the absurd standards that some bureaucrat or Bill Gates-millionaire has set somewhere. So it is absolutely against that. But I also think that this new idea that has existed before, in the 30s and so on, but is being revived right now, is the question of social justice unionism or class struggle unionism. So I was there during the Chicago teachers’ strike, where I think this idea was promoted really, really strongly. The radical caucus within CTU––the Chicago Teachers Union––lots of socialists in that caucus built and fought for this caucus to promote the ideals of social justice unionism. But how exactly did they do it? Before they’ve called a strike or even discussed their demands, for years, they went to Black and brown communities where schools were being closed down and they brought their CTU banner with them. So these communities saw that this union has come to our aid. Every time there was a school closure, a police shooting, the CTU would try to go and advocate for these racialized communities that are the most vulnerable in Chicago, even today…the rampant violence of the Chicago police and the rampant forgivance of the Chicago Police by the system is off the charts. And remember, the slogan that CTU made popular was “our teaching conditions are our students’ learning conditions.” So in other words, how you treat us is basically how you treat the students. And so when the union called for a strike, these communities that they had shown solidarity towards came out in droves to support the teachers’ strike. I was there two days, actually, before the strike, wearing my red CTU t-shirt and walking through the South Side of Chicago. Every car honked, every window opened and waved when they saw a red T-shirt. It was astonishing. And remember, this was like, what, six years ago? So there was nothing called “a strike,” even, in people’s imaginations. So it was just extraordinary to see. So I think this strike wave that we are experiencing now is actually trying to push forward the idea of social justice unionism, which actually combines the life-making activities of workers with the profit-making activities that workers are forced to do. So changing the conditions of life is as important as changing the conditions of work. Now, between you and me, I think that ideal of social justice unionism is not as widespread or generalized as perhaps you and I would like it to be, but I think this is an important beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Let’s turn to the core of the manifesto’s argument for a feminism of the 99 percent. First, you have the model of the feminism that you’re fighting against, which is embodied by Facebook CEO and former Larry Summers chief of staff, Sheryl Sandberg, and her idea that women must “lean in” and win success in business for gender equality to be achieved. You write, “they want a world where the task of managing exploitation in the workplace and oppression in the social whole is shared equally by ruling class men and women, a form of equal opportunity domination.” You contrast this model to that put forward by striking women in Spain, Poland, and elsewhere––feminist movements that are about ending that domination. Explain these two sorts of feminism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Okay, so if you wanted me to create a hashtag for the manifesto besides #feminismforthe99% then my hashtag would be #theglassceilingisalsoaclassceiling. So that’s kind of the message we wanted to get across, that breaking the glass ceiling is only possible for a certain class of women, while the rest of us are in the basement cleaning up that glass. It is an effort to ground the idea of working class power, because feminism, particularly in the neoliberal period––not just in the United States, but I work very closely with feminists in India and that’s prevalent too––is neoliberalism has shaped the discourse on feminism in a particular way. Neoliberal proponents argue that feminism constituted this vague understanding of “empowerment,” and that idea of empowerment was actually immune or immunized from questions such as, for instance, “whose empowerment are we talking about and to what end?” So these are the questions that neoliberalism silences. So feminism came to be neatly conceived as the empowerment of women, which in real terms translated to the empowerment of a tiny upper section of rich women across the world. So feminism came to be equated with success within capitalism. Butargues that if feminism is going to become a threat to sexism and capitalist violence, again, rather than a handmaiden to capitalist development, then feminism has to be of the 99 percent rather than feminism of the 1 percent. So that understanding is very closely tied to the question of working class power and the radical transformation of society. Feminism, we argue, cannot be narrowed to what bourgeois feminists teaches us are feminist issues––for instance, bourgeois feminism says that “equal wages for equal work” is a feminist issue, or abortion is a feminist issue. And we agree. I certainly agree. But equal wages for equal work…equality is a tricky term, right? Is it equality in prosperity or is it equality in misery? I want to be earning the same as my fellow working class men, but if his wage is below poverty level, if his wage is not enough to meet the needs of life-making, then why would I want that wage? I want both wages to be lifted. So actually, wage struggle is a feminist issue. Similarly for abortion. Yes, of course women should have the right to abortion, but is that enough? What if that abortion, the legal right to abortion exists, but abortion clinics are so expensive and the price of abortion is so expensive in other ways in society that only a tiny minority of women actually can access abortion? So what is the point of that? But instead, if we argue for universal healthcare with full abortion facilities, then we are actually talking about a real feminist issue, a feminism for the 99 percent issue, that goes beyond the question of just a legal right to abortion, because then we’re talking about questions of who has the right to give birth and who has the right not to give birth. Because just as abortion is a legal right, the right to have children, particularly in this country with the history of sterilization of women of color, the right to give birth is also a fundamental right that has to be paired with abortion. But then once our child is born, what is the point of having a child if she and I and our family has no access to clean water, to public schools and so on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:This really resonates with the ideas around reproductive freedom advanced by scholars like Dorothy Roberts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Exactly. So Dorothy Roberts is actually one of the key people here who talks about reproductive justice as a whole, rather than just the right to abortion. So that’s kind of where I think the question of working-class power and feminism for the 99 percent are inextricably linked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You make a similar argument in terms of liberal feminism’s approach to domestic violence. You write that laws criminalizing domestic violence and prosecuting its perpetrators are “a cruel hoax if they turn a blind eye to the structural racism and sexism of criminal justice systems, leaving intact police brutality, mass incarceration, deportation threats, military interventions, and harassment and abuse in the workplace.” And then you also note that liberal feminists fail to  “include public services, social housing, and funding to ensure that women can leave domestic and workplace violence.” What is it that liberal feminism obscures about domestic violence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Well, like all social problems, bourgeois feminists and liberal feminists see that at an individual level. So “domestic violence is done by bad men, just as police violence is done by bad police officers.” So these are all “bad apple” theories of social injustice, whereas I think feminists for the 99 percent argue that these threads of violence are actually all connected. For instance, domestic violence is in a way condoned by a society which is highly militarized and values the killing of other people in other countries. So if that is the basis of pride in a country, in the national discourse of a country, that kind of violence and expropriation, then is it any surprise that that country will have a worship of guns and a worship of violence, even at the micro-level, which is the domestic sphere? But the second thing is that working-class men often perpetrate violence against their female partners or family members. And this feminism for the 99 percent does not turn a blind eye to that. And what I’m gonna say next is not a justification for working class violence, far from it, but it is an explanation for working class violence, which is the loss of control in their lives, in their workplaces, in their societies, push men to become the controller, and feel that control is back in their lives when they can beat their female companions or children in the home. So this is the sort of toxicity that bourgeois masculinity combines with the helplessness of working class men in society, and they feel that this is one way to assert their manliness and take back their power and so on. So again, domestic violence is actually not about “bad men doing bad things.” It is a systemic violence that has its roots in much more important institutions of violence that capitalism promotes and upholds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:On those lines, you have a good line in the manifesto. You write, “the gender dynamics we experience today reflect the contradictory dynamics of family and personal life in capitalist society, and these in turn are based in the system’s signature division between people-making and profit-making: family and work.” There is this dynamic that you highlight in the manifesto between sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace and domestic violence in the home, rooted in that very division between the two spaces and the different forms of domination that reign in both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:So if you take the example of the economic processing zones, in the Global South in particular, and the maquiladoras along the US border and so on, these were all institutions––labor regimes––that were set up during the neoliberal period, where companies could absolutely exploit labor as it wished and the government would not be able to interfere. So these are little kingdoms that the companies ran within nations and could, at will, violate all national labor laws. So what happens in these places? I want to use these places as a symbol of that argument about domestic violence and the workplace. Gender violence in particular is rampant in these workplaces: rape, strip searches, all kinds of humiliation, in largely-female workplaces, is the norm in these export processing zones. And women are hired over men in these communities because women are deemed to be more docile. They have nimble fingers to stitch your Gap t-shirts and your H&amp;amp;M trousers. This is the understanding. So what then happens? One is that once this violence is condoned or operates in the workplace, it of course diffuses the rest of society. That it’s allowed here. So gender control becomes a tool of labor control. Secondly, because of the practice in which women are hired over men, the men in these communities are pitted against their sisters and partners and daughters. The men then extend that kind of control in their own sphere of control, which is the home. So in Bangladesh, for instance, I have talked to several female workers in the garment industry, which is where all the textiles go, and they say that “our husbands are very suspicious when we work overtime in these factories, because they say, ‘well why are you out till two in the morning, are you seeing other men?’ whereas we argue that if I don’t do overtime, then we cannot feed the children.” And sometimes, in certain families that I spoke with, doing overtime, they would risk a beating when they got back home, because it was clearly their sexual desires or uncontrolled sexuality that was using overtime as an excuse to stay out late and hang out with other men. So here you see these perfect examples of the imbrication of gender relations and labor relations, where the violence in one strengthens the violence in others and they reinforce each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to talk more about the role of strikes in your manifesto, and more generally, in this emerging left feminist movement that the manifesto is about and addressed to. You argue that the emergent left feminist movement has “invented new ways to strike and infused the strike form itself with a new kind of politics.” In other words, women have struck as women in women’s strikes, a tactic that has emphasized the critical role played by women’s often unpaid work in social reproduction, and thus “broadening the very idea of what counts as labor.” But women workers have also, as we’ve discussed, transformed traditional labor strikes by centering women’s key role in increasingly-critical sectors of wage labor that are socially reproductive, like education and healthcare. And altogether, these fights have highlighted this obscured connection between production and reproduction. Explain your larger argument here about the emergence of these two forms of women’s strikes and the relationship between the two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:The women’s strike, I would say, is a culminating form––new, but culminating form––of the social struggles that went before it. And all of these social struggles were led by women or were about issues that affected women in disproportionate ways to men. For instance, all the struggles we talked about before––water struggles, struggles for housing, and so on, were all led by women because women felt the disproportionate burden of care and living during the neoliberal period. So the women’s strike, if you remember, in 2017, happened after two major mass strikes in Argentina and Poland. The Argentina strike was against femicide, which is very, very related to neoliberal practices in Argentina. There was a marked increase of gender violence and femicide in Argentina with the coming of neoliberalism. And in Poland, there was a mass demonstration in 2016 for abortion rights. And so these two strikes were the instances where women came out in their millions on the streets to protest against these two issues. And several thousand men joined them. And it was basically, in effect, a women’s strike, in the sense that, because millions of women came out in the streets, they were not in their workplace, but they were also not at home, caring for children or washing dishes. So this idea that when women stop, society stops, was then cohered by international feminists in the late fall of 2016. And people argued––we argued––how about a Global Women’s Strike? Which will allow us to reclaim March 8th as International Working Women’s Day. That’s the roots of the Women’s Strike. That’s why we say in the book that it broadens the concept of strike and it broadens the concept of labor. That it is much more effective, that if it becomes a mass strike––in the Rosa Luxemburg sense, not just one workplace strikes or several workplaces strike––that it becomes a mass strike, and that means that women actually have that lever of power to say, “not only will we not work in your factories or your schools or so on, but we will also not work in your homes.” So this is a double blow to the two capitalist circuits, one of life-making and one of commodity production. I think that is really the connection between the current teachers’ strike wave and the women’s strike movement. So even though the teachers’ strike wave or the nurses’ strike or, as Sara Nelson pointed out, the flight attendants’ threat of striking, even though they do not yet have explicit feminist content, their form is actually explicitly feminist, because they are striking not just as teachers but actually as women. If you look at the numbers in America, 80 percent of the workforce of teachers are women, and some of these attacks on them are very, very gendered. And again, it is part of that attack on the care sector of the economy broadly understood. So it is the same as the attack on the freedom to access free water. The same attack on clean air is the same as the attack on public schools. So this is where I think we, as Marxists and revolutionaries, need to constantly emphasize that connection rather than promote one sector of struggle over the other, i.e. the workplace over the non workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to ask about the historical context. You write that, “an anti-capitalist feminism has become thinkable today.” And I want to ask you about a few of the reasons why, starting with one key factor––Hillary Clinton’s 2016 run and loss, which is often, and I think not entirely incorrectly, portrayed as a win for male reaction. But that’s, of course, not the whole story and indeed, part of the story is sort of the opposite of that. You write, “the much ballyhooed candidacy of Hillary Clinton failed to excite women voters, and for good reason. Clinton personified the deepening disconnect between elite women’s ascension to high office and improvements in the lives of the vast majority.” You’re making an argument here entirely contrary to the conventional wisdom that Clinton did embody women’s aspirations. What, for you and for many other women who did not support Hillary Clinton, did she represent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:It really depends on what we are aspiring to. Hillary Clinton’s candidacy absolutely embodied female aspiration, but this was an aspiration to become the leading power to drone bomb other countries, or the leading power to control capitalistic exploitation, or drive down wages. In that sense, it did embody the aspiration of women being at the helm of capitalist social relations, and I think that is not the aspiration that the vast majority of women share, either within America or globally, because America is a global imperialist power. So I don’t think this is of particular significance to my sisters in Afghanistan, that a woman is sending the drones rather than a man. So that’s the first part of it. And the question of Hillary Clinton is also about the question of diversity, in a way. So this is a very neoliberal packaging of the notion of diversity. The way we understood diversity in the 1970s, when it was not called that, or the 80s, we understood there to be anti-racism or anti-sexist struggles. Those were our ways of achieving power for the disempowered––people of color, women, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:A moment before Benetton advertising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Exactly. Exactly. But diversity in effect, under neoliberalism, has come to mean the diversification of the 1 percent. If you look around the globe, the 1 percent is now more diverse than it has ever been in its history. We’ve already elected a Black president when the vast majority of Black lives in the US declined in their welfare, and police violence remained unabated, and if we elect Kamala Harris, for instance, this is a woman who actually advocates for the mass incarceration of Black and brown bodies. So the ruling class is more diversified now than ever before. And this language and politics of neoliberal diversity is used to obscure and stop us from demanding this diversity being applied to all. So rights of Black and brown people, rights of working-class women, are actually silenced because they keep saying, “well, if you elect a rich white woman or you elect a rich Black woman who’s going to serve the purposes of capital, then that’s a way of empowerment.” This is the most narrow sense of representation ever available, in which case, representation becomes a tool for the suppression of those who they claim to represent. So this neoliberal diversification of the 1 percent, I think, is something thatchallenges, in which we argue that diversity is not really the issue here. We do not want diversification of the 1 percent, or the generalization of poverty and racism. What we do want is the vast majority of people, especially people from oppressed communities, to be given the right to decide our own futures. That’s really the demand here, rather than the empowerment of a few rich women to positions of power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I’m thinking back to Clinton’s concession speech on election night, when she lamented, “we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling.” And I’m wondering, do you think it’s fair to say that liberal feminism as a hegemonic project is centrally about identifying the particular interests of elite women like Clinton as representing the interests of women as a whole? Is that, at its core, what it’s doing symbolically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Absolutely. So this is why I began by saying that the glass ceiling is actually a class ceiling. Clinton is all for equal pay for equal work, but not for questioning the conditions that make work unbearable and wages low. It doesn’t matter to her that all wages are low. It just means that she can claim a formal equality of having achieved equal pay for equal work between men and women. So bourgeois feminism and liberal feminism really is about the empty shell of juridical equality. It’s about what rights we can gain from the state. And this is a dangerous argument, because it could be construed that I’m arguing against juridical rights––absolutely not. But I think we should argue that juridical rights are the beginning of a process, rather than the end of a process. A juridical right is not a right at all unless we create conditions for substantiating those rights. And this is where, I think, socialists and feminists for the 99 percent, are pointing to that disjuncture between Clinton’s feminism and our feminism, where Clinton wants to stop at gaining a particular juridical right while we want that right to be applicable, and the conditions created for the right to be applicable, to all of us, not just to Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:There is one very strong and funny (if it wasn’t actually entirely terrifying) piece of recent evidence that this sort of feminism is losing its legitimacy and that is senator and presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar being revealed as the cruelest, most vilely abusive boss imaginable, and the initial feeble efforts by some to characterize these reports as sexist attacks on a strong elder woman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:You can probably guess my answer to that, but I’m going to match that story with another story that came to us during the first Women’s Strike of 2017. One of our speakers in New York on the day of the strike was this fantastic trans woman who worked at a shop called Pleasure Chest. It’s located in New York and its owner was a woman. This is a feminist store: it sells sex toys and pleasure manuals and things like that. And the boss was very, very feminist. So our trans comrade said, “this was something that attracted me to go work for the store, but I understood quickly that she was a feminist only up to the point that we did not demand a raise in our wages.” So at the rally, the comrade called it “boss feminism.” That she was fine with her commitment to equality and emancipation until her workers demanded a higher wage. And she absolutely refused, and so the workers actually walked out in strike. So that’s when what feminism is was revealed to everyone––that feminism is actually incompatible with boss feminism, that that is not about emancipation, that is about finding a place for a minority of women within capitalism. And that cannot be a real feminist goal at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:In terms of the origins of this moment, where does the 2017 Women’s March fall in terms of the role that it has played? It represented, I think, quite a few and sometimes quite contradictory strands of American feminism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:The Women’s March in January of 2017 was, I would say, one of the most brilliant events in American social movements. More than a million people marched in various parts of the country on that day in January. People wanted to express directly and openly their condemnation of the new president and it came in all kinds of forms, people from all kinds of lives, all walks of life, women, men, children joined that march. And I think it was fantastic. What was not so fantastic, I think, was how the leadership envisioned that march and what they had in place to offer as solutions to these million people who came out. For instance, we had supporters of Zionism, Scarlett Johansson, speaking at the march. So when our comrade Angela Davis, who is basically unstoppable in any conditions, when she came on and she just said “we need to fight for Palestine,” I was literally whooping. Someone needs to use that forbidden word. And of course, she did––which was Palestine. So it is interesting that the march was cast by the march organizers as non-political. They didn’t even say that this would be sort of a solution to Trump,  or “these are the ways we are going to succeed against Trump.” It was just a show of power. Now, a show of power is very important, but it is particularly important to create infrastructures from that show of power which can sustain social protest beyond the one day of marching. I think that didn’t quite happen in 2017 and the heterogeneity of the politics of the march I don’t think was particularly representative of the heterogeneity of the people who came to the march. For instance, the framing was very liberal feminist framing, in which there were certain fissures and breakthrough like Angela Davis, but the general framing of it was very liberal feminist. In other words, it didn’t really offer any concrete solutions to the people who came out for it. And I think that was a missed opportunity, although I will say that the Women’s March’s new platform is very good. I am very pleased with it and it really addresses a lot of social issues. It talks about Islamophobia and so on. So I am pleased. But I think it’s because the movement has pushed the organizers to move left to a certain extent. So that was important. One of the things that we tried to highlight on March 8, following from the Women’s March, was yes we are against Trump, but we are against the conditions that created Trump. So that way we are signaling our opposition or hostility to the entire Democratic apparatus that actually went before in creating  the neoliberal conditions that ultimately gave rise to this neoliberal monster of Trump. He is a creation of the processes that came before him…in order to mark ourselves clearly that this wasn’t just an anti-Trump protest, this was actually a protest against capitalism as a whole. And we cannot ensure that more Trumps will not arise unless we attack the basis of that creation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Let’s talk a little bit more about some of the basis of that creation, about the history of progressive neoliberalism, this tethering of pro-diversity social politics to neoliberal economics that you all argue laid the groundwork in so many ways for right-wing populist reaction. Can you explain how it did so? I take it that it wasn’t, as some might portray it, because of so-called excesses in the racial and gender justice movements provoking an inevitable backlash against progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Let’s look at neoliberalism’s tackling of race in America. So first, there is no acknowledgement in any of that neoliberal discourse of the transformative power of racism in this country and of the slave trade in this country, which was basically the basis of capitalist production worldwide and particularly in America. So if we don’t understand that as one of the key motors of capitalism, then how can we even acknowledge what the legacies of that history are? There is no such understanding in neoliberalism. Instead, there is a scolding by neoliberal politicians that the condition of Black lives and brown lives in America are because that they have made poor choices. This is the absolute discourse of neoliberalism: our conditions are what they are because we fail to make the right choices, that people like Cory Booker or Hillary Clinton have made. So Obama’s famous statement, “pull up your pants,” quintessentially captures this scolding discourse of neoliberalism towards Black and brown communities in this country. So this is their approach towards race: that race is not a product of structural violence that was committed in the past and the legacies of which we carry through and are sustained by capitalism, but instead, racist problems are because of particular individuals, and if they didn’t make those choices, then everyone could be the president of the United States. So this discourse then severs the relationship between class and race in a particular way. This is where progressive neoliberalism, with all their talk of diversity, actually has no clue about what allows for Black life. Well, actually, they do have a clue––but they systematically silence that––of what creates poverty and deprivation in communities of color in this country and how widespread it is. Basically, our access to water and air are racialized, like in the case of Detroit. Now in response to this, we have the archaic troglodytes coming back to claim the discourse of class. So Trump is basically attacking establishment––well, in 2016, anyway––he was attacking establishment politicians for ignoring the lives of the working class. So this class rhetoric is being reclaimed by these virulent racists. This is the same in Hungary with Orban, Bolsanaro in Brazil––they are trying to say that they now stand for class values and class emancipation. And of course, their class values are violently guarded against communities of color, migrants, and so on. I think this is the terrain that feminists for the 99 percent as well as the labor movement found itself post-2016. How do we navigate between progressive neoliberalism and archaic, open racism and misogyny? And I think it is a terrain that we are still navigating but I think we are building consensus now that actually, both of those choices are false choices and that we need to chart an independent path for working class power which challenges the very basic premise of capitalism rather than finds little accommodating spaces within it. So I think that consensus is building and the strikes, both the women’s strikes as well as the teachers’ strikes and so on, are helping in that, but I think we still have a long way to go before this becomes a generalized class instinct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And one reason your book is so important is that debates on the left are also plagued by this divide between class and identity politics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Yes. This is a particular bugbear of mine, particularly, as you can imagine, as a woman of color and a Marxist and revolutionary socialist. So we are given two choices. One is that we reject that oppression exists and we just start from the premise that all of us are equal, at least in the left movement. All of us are equal. And we claim this loudly in meetings which are dominated by men. So men get up constantly in meetings and say, in lots of fancy ways, that we are all equal. The women are not that vocal. This is one choice, that we accept equality as the premise, as if it already exists, and the other is that we reject it altogether. And we say that everything is on the basis of class and all identities are false. So the left discourse is not that identities are false, but we say “in the socialist movement, we are all equal,” while the particular class reductionist argument is “identities are bad altogether, because it comes in the way of equality.” For us, I think if we start from the premise that all differences are invalid, then we actually cannot create a universal ground for solidarity. The universalism we talk about is not a given, but has to be built towards. And it is a dangerous move to move towards that notion of a universality in the making, as we call it, if we deny differences. Because the differences that exist within our class are for very historical reasons and have had very unequal and violent consequences. And so our premise should be to acknowledge those differences in the first place and then build common ground through struggle, rather than assume that common ground already exists, because that assumption, I think, is particularly harmful within the socialist movement as well as the union movement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:In other words, it’s racism and sexism under capitalism that divide us, not anti-racist politics or feminist politics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:That’s correct. So that’s definitely the argument, that if we have to have a multiracial, multigendered unity of the working class, then it has to be first assumed that this unity does not exist yet and we work towards it. And the best way to work towards it is through solidarity in struggle. One of the things we say in the manifesto is, “struggle is a school, it teaches.” And so through struggle, we build this process of building this universality, rather than taking it for granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And you argue that struggle is the way to build a coalition that wins over “the working-class factions of the two dominant pro-capitalist political blocs: progressive neoliberalism on the one hand and reactionary right-wing populism on the other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Correct. A lot of working-class people, I think, voted for Hillary Clinton––as well as working-class people voted for Trump. Now, I do not hold to the idea that some mythical white working class elected Trump, because actually it has been proved now, beyond doubt, that it was mostly petty bourgeois support and small business owners that were the basis of Trump’s victory. But this is not to deny that many working-class people voted for Hillary and Trump. And this is because a vast section of the working class actually bought that divide that has been taught to them for years…one was the Democrats, represented by Hillary Clinton, was going to fight for progressive gains, while the other part believed that Trump was going to bring jobs back to the Midwest. That was the the false choice offered to them. And I think our job is not to condemn these working-class people for having made that choice, because that’s like condemning working-class people for having any kind of capitalist idea, which we all hold. Instead, our job should be to make it clear that these are not the two choices and to draw working-class people into the socialist struggle, into the struggle for feminism for the 99 percent. So that should be the project, rather than snide remarks or supercilious understanding of why working-class people make those voting choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:We’ve discussed the relationship between liberal feminism and neoliberalism in some depth. But what about liberal feminism’s relationship to patriarchy? Can liberal feminism even be described as feminism, given that it bolsters a capitalist system that itself fundamentally relies on sexism, and for that matter, on racism and other forms of oppression as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:That’s a great question and I think it’s difficult to answer, because I would be inclined to say that this is not the real feminist project at all because it’s not about emancipation. It is about empowering the 1 percent women. However, it is also true that Hillary Clinton was being attacked for being a woman, which is what a lot of the Trump camp was doing, or even non-Trump camp. That’s where I think we should defend that, because I always say that there are so many better reasons to attack Hillary Clinton than from being a woman. I will give you a list! But because sexism exists, I think Hillary Clinton will always be, under capitalism, attacked as a woman. And similarly, Barack Obama will always be attacked for being Black, although there are so many reasons to attack Obama which are nothing to do with his race at all. And so under these conditions, I think for Hillary Clinton to claim that she represents feminism, there is, I would say, a partial truth to it––a very partial truth. It’s a truth embedded in capitalist social relations, which is why I don’t say that it has any solution to that oppression. But I think we have to acknowledge that even Hillary Clinton is affected by the existence of sexism in society. And that’s why I say it’s a difficult answer. The best way I think I can put it is yes, she fights sexism as long as it affects her class. So that’s why I think calling it liberal feminism gives it the right content in the sense that she does fight for women’s rights, but only for women’s rights as it applies to her class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Another thing that I think is really important about the argument you all make in this manifesto is that this division between reproductive and productive labor is then divided along racial lines, and a big part of that is a system that allows elite women to “lean in” by leaning on working-class migrant women for childcare and housework. Explain what global care chains are, the role they play within the domestic political economy, and also, the broader global political-economic order and how they relate to your broader argument that, “generalized misogyny and control over all women’s bodies fundamentally depends upon racism, imperialism, and ethnonationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Okay, so let’s look at the very phenomenon of migration. Migration happens now…of displaced people from the Global South to the Global North. So why are they migrating? I mean, if we have any sense of what home means to all of us, we can understand that people don’t migrate because they just want to you get up one morning and go have Coca-Cola in a homeless shelter in New York. People migrate because of things done to them. This is something I want to emphasize, that poverty and displacement did not happen to people. That’s a passive voice question. These things were done to these people. Poverty and displacement were imposed on these people, rather than them existing as if it’s a part of nature. So if we look at the vast majority of migration into Europe, it is from the Middle East. And who created the conditions of instability in the Middle East? It is Western powers: NATO, leading the European and American alliance. If we look at Latin America, what is causing all the migrant women to come into the United States? It’s because of policies by the World Bank, the IMF, all backed by Global North capital, and the policies of installing dictatorships on behalf of America that have created these conditions of absolute desperation and instability in these countries to force women to come look for livelihood as best as they can in order to care for their families. So what happens to these women when they end up in in the Global North? And I want to emphasize that migrant women workers do not just end up in the care circuit. They form the vast majority of cleaners, for instance, in hotels. They form the vast majority of agricultural workers in the strawberry fields of California. So this is a very, very common phenomenon. But they also form a huge majority of care work in this country as nannies and house workers and domestic help, which then allows their mistresses in the house to actually go out and have a job. So that’s the phenomenon we are referring to. But I think we have to emphasize here the right of migrant women within the context of migration itself. Big capital is actually not hostile to migration. For instance, a lot of the section of capital is actually opposed to Trump’s border wall––that if migration stops entirely, then who are they going to use to do their dirty jobs and pay less and hence create more profit? Big capital is often not hostile to migration. What they’re hostile to is equal rights for migrant workers, because it is the condition of migrancy that is most valuable for capital, right, where you can be a worker but actually have no rights within that system to fight any injustice done to you, either in the workplace in the form of low wages, or in the field, when the manager threatens rape, which is one mode of control of migrant workers everywhere. And similarly, in the home, when the master of the house is sexually violent towards you, you have no recourse in that sense. So if we are going to talk about migrant women and the kind of jobs they perform in countries of the Global North, we cannot not tackle the question of open borders at all. We have to talk about open borders and equal rights for every worker within a nationally-bounded entity or a nation state––equal rights for all workers, irrespective of their citizenship status, because that is the only way to actually tackle the absolutely rampant gender violence towards migrant women and also to counter this unequal division within women’s work, where the work of the many allows the work of the few women to continue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:My last question is a “where do we go from here” question. You argue that we don’t just need to seize the means of production and whatnot, but to also dramatically transform the relationship between production and reproduction. What would that look like and how do we do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:The main thinking behind that comment is this: that right now, the relations of social reproduction are subsumed or lessened or are put second to the relation of commodity production. So social reproduction is allowed to exist, or promoted, to the extent that it does not disrupt profit-making. Of course, capitalists are not willing to pay benefits and so on because those are the things that cut into profit-making. That’s kind of the capitalist arrangement, where social reproduction is subordinated to production. We want to change that. And this is the demand for social movements worldwide: people before profit. That’s a very social reproduction demand, that we want to put the needs of people before the greed of profit. That’s why these kinds of things, like public schools, public hospitals, public transport, etc. are seen as arenas of expenditure by the state. We need to absolutely change that economic thinking, where these things are actually severed from this traditional finance mechanism, which means a restructuring of the finance structure in the short run, but in the long run, to actually transform all social relationships by putting the needs of people before capitalist needs. That’s kind of our thinking behind what is needed, which is promoting the relations of social and production over the relations of commodity production. So that’s what’s needed. How do we get there? Obviously, challenging capitalism in both arenas of social reproduction and production is the only way forward. The collective struggle on the basis of working class solidarity, the building of a mass working class, multigendered, multiracial movement is the solution to this process––and the only tool we have to upturn that relationship between social reproduction and capitalism. However, I want to say two things. One, I think we have some really important history to learn from working-class struggle. And I think many, many projects are happening right now which are trying to popularize and remind us of working-class histories, of histories of both victory and defeat of our side. Learning that history is very important towards our final goal. But I also think we have to be careful, because we have to treat our context in which, despite the devastation and the imperialist and racist history of this country, we actually have a rising mass socialist consciousness right now. The struggles around Bernie Sanders, the teachers’ strikes, the nurses’ strikes––all this speaks of a so-far inchoate, but absolutely happening, rising class consciousness. All lessons from history will not map very neatly onto our social present. So while we need to be very open about the past, we also have to forge certain new tools and new histories for our current moment in order to anticipate the future, because no past movement where socialism became a mass force had the climate crisis as an urgent reminder to the end of life as we know it. This is our generation’s new time clock. We have the clock ticking, while previous socialist moments did not in this particular sense. Well they did, but they didn’t realize they did. And so for us, certain things will be different. And I think we have to be open to thinking anew, rather than using block quotes from Marx. So that’s my way of kind of combining the theoretical lessons from social reproduction theory and ecofeminism and so on with the organizational experiments that we need to make to actually apply the method of that theory to our current moment. But I want to finish with one marvelous comment from people that I consider the foremothers of feminism for the 99 percent, and this was in 1908 in Russia, at the All-Russian Women’s Congress, and this was an All-Russian Women’s Congress mainly framed by liberal feminists who were arguing for suffrage, but nothing beyond suffrage. So Alexandra Kollontai organized working class and peasant women to basically gate crash the conference. And while that debate was on, that suffrage is great but suffrage is not enough, one of the working-class women actually yelled these words onto the bourgeois feminists on the podium. She said, “what do you know of our lives, bowling along in your carriages while we get splashed with mud?” That, I think, encapsulates what we are trying to say with feminism for the 99 percent, and it is a source of great joy to me to read quotes such as this from the past to know that we have foremothers in this struggle. But it is also very sobering for me to then apply the spirit of past struggles to our current moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Tithi Bhattacharya, thank you very much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB:Thank you, Daniel, for having me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking women have begun to reclaim feminism as a project of working-class struggle against not only patriarchy’s domination of women by men but also against capitalism’s domination of the many by the few—a system that sexism serves. As Cinzia Arruzza, Tithi Bhattacharya and Nancy Fraser write in 
, “Our answer to lean-in feminism is kick-back feminism. We have no interest in breaking the glass ceiling while leaving the vast majority to clean up the shards. Far from celebrating women CEOs who occupy corner offices, we want to get rid of CEOs and corner offices.” Dan interviews Tithi Bhattacharya.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What might Bernie 2020 look like, particularly now that almost everyone claims to be for Medicare for All (whatever they might mean by that)? Will Harris’ track record as a law-and-order prosecutor doom her, or will her appeal as a woman of color rally a decisive number of votes? And will Biden being exposed as utterly unfit for the 2020 Democratic base send his poll numbers crashing? What impact will AOC have on defining what voters want and demand? Dan discusses all of this and more with Briahna Gray, Dave Weigel and Waleed Shahid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Denvir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Welcome to The Dig, a podcast from Jacobin Magazine. My name is Daniel Denvir and I’m temporarily broadcasting from Santiago de Chile. Two new left-wing Muslim women elected to Congress, Palestinian American Rashid Tlaib and Somali American Ilhan Omar, are resetting the congressional debate over Palestine. In response, they have been met with vociferous and slanderous attacks. On the one hand, this is exciting. We’ve never had people in Congress who not only criticize Israeli brutality but also support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. On the other hand, the current debate is a sobering reminder of how, amongst American elected officials, overwhelming bipartisan and nearly unconditional support for Israel remains the norm even as Democratic voters moved sharply to the left and sharply in opposition to the occupation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born Palestinian Muslim American activist and organizer. She’s the co-founder of Empower Change, the first Muslim founded and led online organizing platform, and is a national organizer with the Women’s March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Linda Sarsour. Welcome back to The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda Sarsour:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 What exactly have representatives Tlaib and Omar done to so infuriate Republican and Democratic supporters of Israel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and congresswoman Rashida Tlaib––their only crime has been existing and breathing. They are unapologetic Muslim American women. Rashida, as you know, is Palestinian American and very unapologetic about that, and Ilhan Omar is unapologetically pro-Palestinian and pro-Palestine and that’s really what it is. It’s for them being bold and articulate and being able to reach the masses in a way that members of Congress haven’t been able to do on this particular issue before. It is driving them nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There’s this remarkable opening to a recent New York Times article on the controversy that, for me, was revealing of the limits of mainstream American liberals. It reads, “Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were hailed as symbols of diversity when they were sworn in last month as the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, Ms. Tlaib in her mother’s hand-embroidered Palestinian thobe, Ms. Omar in tradition-shattering hijab. Four weeks later, their uncompromising views on Israel have made them perhaps the most embattled new members of the Democratic House majority.” It’s like Democrats love them when they were just passive symbols of diversity––sitting there looking Muslim and like women of color. But now that they have substantial views that differ from lockstep support for Israel, oh, now they’re a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, it’s not that their views are all so different. Their views are in line with the majority of Americans and particularly with a majority of progressives, and the Democratic Party is going to have to come to terms with that. And so for me what Rashida and Ilhan represent once and for all for the Democratic Party is a reckoning. It’s that this is your moment, and so Rashida and Ilhan are not bringing in some outrageous pie in the sky, they just made those things up as they went along. They’re bringing in sentiments of the progressives who put them in office and of the groups that put them in office, groups like Justice Democrats, the groups that are out here, like the Democratic Socialists of America, like the People for Bernie types. This sentiment of ending occupation in Palestine, of supporting Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, or at least at the minimum, the right for people to engage in Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, the idea that being a staunch critic of the state of Israel does not equal being anti-Semitic. This is just mainstream now. This is just normal. And watching young Jewish Americans who are going on these Birthright trips and every week we see a new story of young people walking off these trips so they can go explore Occupation and meet Palestinians and really see the real suffering that they unfortunately have never been exposed to because that’s not what Birthright is about, is really eye-opening for everyone and the Democratic Party has to make a choice, like whose side are you on here? Are you on the side of the majority of voters in the progressive community, are you on the side of young people, are you on the side of a large swath of Jewish Americans? I mean you know this Daniel, like in the pro-Palestinian movement, particularly in the United States of America, the people on the front lines oftentimes are Jewish Americans who are like, occupation should not be done in my name. The building of illegal settlements should not be done in my name. And they have been vocal about it for decades. So it’s really interesting just to watch the Democratic Party have to sit here and decide that it is––are Rashida and Ilhan the problem? Or are we the problem and we have to figure out how to move on this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 According to a recent Pew poll, the percentage of liberal Democrats who sympathize more with Israel than Palestinians has fallen from 33% to 19% over just three years time, and as you mentioned, this is something that very much involves Jewish Americans, particularly young Jews who are far more attracted to the anti-occupation politics of groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow than they are to AIPAC. Do you think at least some Democratic politicians are beginning to realize that their voters’ attitudes towards the occupation are shifting left and that “progressive, except for Palestine” is no longer workable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. Recently we saw it with the anti-BDS legislation in the Senate. Every single senator who either has announced to run for president or is going to announce that they’re running for president voted against it. And I know that for some of them they don’t––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Though Booker and Harris didn’t vote. Which is something, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well it’s still something, but what ended up happening, Daniel, is that they did not vote during the––there was two votes; there was a procedural vote and then there was the “real” vote that happened. So when the real vote came up, both Booker and Harris actually voted against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Now mind you, Booker has been longtime ally and friend of AIPAC; Harris has been to AIPAC and has probably gotten support from AIPAC in the past. And even they knew that in order to run and attract progressive swaths of voters from around the country and different groups of people, they knew that that anti-BDS legislation––if in fact they would have voted for it––would have hurt them in the primary race. And the fact that they are realizing that now tells me that the work that has been happening on the ground in the grassroots, making this issue of Palestine a mainstream issue, is working. And it is driving the very staunch pro-Israel groups crazy and I don’t know if you saw, there was a new group that has come out trying to paint themselves as liberal Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Democratic Majority for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes, the Democratic Majority for Israel. When I saw that I honestly chuckled, because I said to myself, wow, we must be really doing a good job, if some liberal Democrats think that they have to start a whole new organization to maintain Democratic support for Israel. My issue here is this: we know a lot of people who call themselves all kinds of things. You know, liberal Zionist; there’s a lot of people all across the spectrum. But there are some fundamentals here, Daniel. And this is what Democrats have to understand. There must be an end to occupation. This is an illegal military occupation being paid for by taxpayer dollars. We must be unequivocal when we stand against the murder, the assassinations, the sniping of peaceful protesters in Gaza. We have to be unequivocal when we say we have to break the siege on Gaza which has been called by all human rights organizations, not me, the world’s largest open air prison. I mean, 50% of the people who live in Gaza are under the age of 18. We have to be unequivocal in saying that the Palestinian people still deserve to have aid. I mean these are people who don’t have their own economy in the way that other nations do. And they need to have the support of the United States. We’ve seen what has happened with the cuts in aid to the Palestinian people. So there are just some fundamental things, I think, where people don’t agree on some things and where there’s still some things that are up for debate; for some, it’s whether you support a two state solution, whether you support one state, one binational state. Those are things that come later. But the fundamentals: end the occupation in Palestine. End the illegal settlements. And stop killing innocent protesters and end the siege on Gaza. And I think more Democrats are more willing to say those things and Bernie Sanders is one who has been quite vocal as a Jewish American senator and as someone who is bidding to be the next president of the United States of America, and he’s setting a standard and people are following. I mean, when I watch Dianne Feinstein in California write a letter to her colleagues telling them to vote against the anti-BDS legislation and she herself voting for it, she’s not exactly a progressive. So the fact that Dianne Feinstein voted against the anti-BDS legislation, I was like, okay, so we’re onto something here. There really is a shift in this country and I’m very proud of the work of the activists and organizers and people who’ve been doing this for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And before we move on, let’s talk briefly about that Senate anti-BDS bill. What would it do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This anti-BDS legislation, basically it wants to empower the states and give protections to states around the country who are engaging in also passing anti-BDS legislation on the state level. So what has happened right now is states that have been passing anti-BDS legislation have been sued immediately by organizations like the ACLU or the Council on American-Islamic Relations, including in a recent one in Texas, where an Arabic-speaking Palestinian speech pathologist in Houston––the only Arabic-speaking speech pathologist in Houston––was asked to renew her contract, and when she went to sign her contract, it asked her to pledge that she never engage in Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions of Israel––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Good God––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And she was like, hell no. Her name is Bahia Amawi and you will see many articles about her. So she, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, and the ACLU and others have been suing states and in fact have been winning in places like Arizona and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 On pretty obvious First Amendment grounds, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Obvious First Amendment rights. I mean, this is like Constitution 101. And what the federal piece of legislation wants to do, is it wants to give cover to those states to make these lawsuits even harder to win in these states. And it’s absolutely outrageous. So this is to people who are listening in, and obviously a lot of Jacobin supporters and people who listen to The Dig are usually our people, but even if you are not sure where you are on this particular issue, I don’t actually ask anyone nor do I force anyone to be a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement. That’s fine if you don’t support it, but you have to support our constitutional rights and the constitutional rights of Americans to engage in Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, whether that be of Israel or Saudi Arabia or other nations that are engaging in human rights violations. It’s just very commonsense and also basic Constitution 101.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One thing that I don’t get, is why is AIPAC and the Israel lobby pushing this bill now? Weirdly, it seems like the right is doing the left’s work for us by putting BDS in the spotlight and forcing a debate over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This is what they call, Daniel, desperation. What you do when you are in a frantic state and you have no idea what to do, so you’re just throwing every tactic that you have on the table as fast as you can, hoping that something sticks. And to your point, what it’s doing is it’s alarming to a lot of Americans because they’re like, this is not the priority right now. We have babies at the border who are being separated from their parents. We just read another article saying that the government has and continues to have no intention of bringing these families together. We have the DACA kids who are out here without their DACA protection, still in court. We have outrageous issues of mass deportations in this country. We have a president who is engaging in all kinds of illegal behavior. And we’re waiting for something to stick somewhere on somebody. And hearing our complicit support in the war in Yemen and watching these videos every day of these kids that are literally dying of malnutrition and cholera. I mean, the videos on healthcare and people not having access to healthcare. I can sit here for days talking about the outrageousness. The bans on––even if you’re anti-war––but the bans on trans in the military tells you all you need to know about this administration, of what they’re capable of doing or what they can do to people that don’t align with evangelical Christian values and beliefs. So there’s a lot of outrageous things that are out here. And here we are focusing on silencing people’s right to free speech. I’ve spoken to people who are saying, well I support the state of Israel but I don’t support the silencing of free speech in America. And that’s why I need people to do it at the basic minimum. So these people are really doing, to your point, doing our job for us, because when people come to talk to me about it, I’m like, what’s the problem? And another question that gets asked to me, Daniel, all the time is, okay, there’s a lot of countries that engage in human rights violations, why is there this focus, this obsession with the state of Israel? And what I say to people all the time is that it’s not that there is an obsession with the state of Israel. Obviously Saudi Arabia is one of the bigger purveyors of violating human rights of people of their nation, including those that are not nationals of Saudi Arabia, maybe workers and others that reside in Saudi. But we all know that––violation of the rights of women in Saudi Arabia. That’s all very clear. But what we’re doing is we’re selling arms deals to Saudi Arabia, which we need to stop immediately, and making money off of Saudi Arabia. And when people bring up examples like North Korea, I say to people, look, North Korea is absolutely a violator of the human rights of the North Korean people. But guess what? It’s not my taxpayer dollars that pay for their oppression. But in Israel, the overwhelming majority of aid that goes to military aid goes to Israel and Egypt. So for me, as a person who fights for Medicare for All, and wants my fellow Americans to have access to healthcare, and I want people to have a debt free college and free college tuition and all these things that I know we can have as a country, here is a nation that’s taking our taxpayer dollars and using it to illegally occupy a people and engage in human rights violations and, in fact, pass nation state laws that create apartheid. And there is clear apartheid. There is clear superiority for some people in Israel over others and that’s not something that I made up on my own. This is enshrined in the nation state laws of Israel. So that’s why people focus on Israel as someone who takes our taxpayer dollars and we should be consistent Americans and believe in the human rights of all people, and when our taxpayer dollars are not being used in an appropriate matter or used to violate the human rights of other people, we should be able to say hey, hold on a second. This is not right. And we should be able to speak up about it. And that’s all we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And this argument that critics of Israel are unfairly singling out or obsessively focused on Israel is off base, if not entirely in many cases, disingenuous. Because it is precisely the same groups and people in the United States who have been critical of Israel who have been at the lead of criticizing regimes like Saudi Arabia’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. I’ve been one of them and they’ve pulled out some out of context tweets, and I remember one time a few years ago, if you remember, Daniel, in New York, we were working on a paid sick leave campaign and trying to get New York state to pass paid sick leave legislation. And I had one time made a very facetious, sarcastic tweet where I said that even in Saudi Arabia, they have paid maternity leave. I had a daughter in 2004. I worked for a major New York City hospital at the time in 2004. I had a daughter, I’m at the time very lower middle class, I was working check to check because that’s just how it is in New York with rent and other expenses. She was my third child, and I had to go on disability because my hospital––an actual hospital––didn’t have maternity leave policies. So I got really passionate about being part of the New York State paid sick leave campaign. And so one time I made a facetious tweet where I said “even Saudi Arabia.” What I really meant to say was, even Saudi Arabia, which is a country that violates the rights of women on a consistent basis and does a lot of other human rights violations against workers and other poor people in Saudi Arabia––that even they have maternity leave. Right. And so for me, recently, because of my staunch opposition to the Saudi-led war in Yemen and calling out the complicity of the United States and starting to zone in on what’s happening, I don’t know if you saw, but Ilhan Omar, Rashida, and myself were attacked by Saudi-owned media. So the Saudis were going after me, Ilhan, and Rashida, saying all kinds of outrageous things about us because of our vocal opposition to what Saudi Arabia is doing, but in particular what they’re doing in Yemen. So people have to really be talking about what’s happening in context. Like right now, I don’t know if you know, there’s a couple of performers, like Mariah Carey and a couple of others, who are going to perform in Saudi Arabia. The Yemenis and their supporters are like, hey Mariah Carey, don’t go perform in Saudi Arabia––which is what we do to entertainers we want to go perform in Israel, it’s very similar. Maybe people are not calling it BDS Saudi Arabia, but isn’t in fact calling on people to boycott going to Saudi Arabia, it’s the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There was the same demand in the anti-Apartheid movement against the South African government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. We’re not doing anything new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One thing that’s really interesting about this moment of all the politics around Israel and Palestine being so in flux in the U.S. is that the group that we mentioned earlier, Democratic Majority for Israel, its president, Mark Mellman, actually opposes the anti-BDS bill, and I imagine that it is because he correctly believes that it will drive this process of partisan polarization on the issue that Democratic pro-Israel types fear, because ultimately if Israel-Palestine becomes a partisan issue, that’s good for Palestinian liberation and bad for the occupation. The pro-Israel establishment, Netanyahu, they’ve decided that Christian Zionists, rather than American Jews, are their real base of support in the U.S., and this is all part of this larger process of polarization where bipartisan consensus is fracturing. And that’s often a good thing. And Netanyahu has thrown himself fully behind Trump and Republicans and that no doubt serves his short term interests, but some Zionists and hardcore Israel advocates like Mellman I think are a bit smarter than Bibi, and they understand that the Republican Party is not the future governing party in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Oh, absolutely. I saw that in the article and it’s very strategic on their part. And to just to give them a little bit of credit, the fact that they even believe that they have to exist was really what made me chuckle, because they understood that they were losing ground on their arguments and that the progressive movement in particular has really taken on this issue. I read an article recently in The Washington Post that was an analysis, and the woman was asking a question and saying how did the feminist movement include anywhere from environmentalism to Palestinian rights? And that was my indication that people are starting to realize that this new wave of organizers and activists at this moment, particularly those who are leading in the women’s rights movement, are actually not just preaching intersectionality, but in fact implementing it in the larger movements we’re a part of. And in order for us to say we stand up for the human rights of all people, we stand up for the dignity of all people, and looking at ourselves as Americans as part of a larger global community is something that Americans are not really used to doing. There have been factions of organizing and movements that have seen themselves as globalist and seen themselves as part of a larger kind of pan-African liberation movement and all other types of movements that include other–– if we’re free here in the States, if we’re not free here then people in other parts of the world are free. And that has been something that we have seen over the course of the past decades. But as a larger feminist movement in America, a women’s rights movement in the way that we’re trying to do it now, Palestinian rights are at the table because they’re part of a larger progressive agenda––environmentalism, criminal justice reform, immigrant rights. We’re not just the women’s movement that’s talking about access to reproductive rights and also equal pay, which has kind of been what traditional white feminism has really been about, it’s about equity, particularly equity to white men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Especially at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Especially at the top. For example, recently I saw this image of the head of the Department of Homeland Security, the head of the CIA, and the head of the Department of Defense are all women. And I was like that’s not what I’m fighting for. I’m not fighting for women to be at the top of the most oppressive government agencies. That’s not what I’m fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Kate Aronoff tweeted, “what wave of feminism is this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
I was doing that whole, I’m not with them, they are not with me. So it’s been interesting to see how polarizing it’s been for people to hear Palestinian rights come up and you’ve known this, Daniel, from our controversy at the Women’s March, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 At the Women’s March, we’ve gotten into a lot of controversy. A lot of it was around this controversy about Tamika Mallory going to an event where Minister Farrakhan spoke. What people haven’t really realized, Daniel, and we’ve been very clear about unequivocally rejecting anti-Semitism and homophobia and transphobia and all forms of racism, and we’ve done it multiple times, we’ve been very unequivocal and clear that we do not agree with the statements of Minister Farrakhan, they do not align with our unity principles at the Women’s March, in fact Minister Farrakhan is not a member of the progressive left and he will tell you that himself. We do not answer for the Minister Farrakhan. We’ve been very clear about all of that. But what’s interesting is people don’t know, and you may know because you’re part of this kind of work and the circle, is that we were getting attacked way before we ever got into the situation. And in particular I was the focus of the attacks because of my support for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, and my specific positions on Israel-Palestine to the point where back in May of 2017, which is the same year as the Women’s March, every alt-right celebrity in America literally came out to do a rally against me in front of the CUNY administrative buildings, calling on CUNY to disinvite me from being a commencement speaker at a graduation for the CUNY Graduate School. And what was very interesting about that is that when I sent somebody to infiltrate the protest to get footage to see who the people were, like who were these people that were coming out to this particular rally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Who felt so passionately about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. And mind you, these are proponents of free speech and ironically calling on me to be cancelled, which is very ironic and was very funny. But, for example, Aaron––remember the attorney, who stopped the two Spanish-speaking women in the restaurant and there was this whole big thing in New York––Schlossberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 He was one of the organizers and he was there, I have him on videotape. You had former Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a very staunch right-wing Zionist in New York. You had Pamela Geller. You had Milo Yiannopoulos. You had Richard Spencer, you had Gavin McInnes. Basically, they had the celebrities of the alt-right. And some members of the audience, a very small number of men who were wearing yarmulkes, that were the color red––I have them on video––that said Jews for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 A group of very normal people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It was a very interesting group of people. But my point is, when I say to people in the pro-Israel movement, particularly those who say that they’re pro-Israel but they also want to end occupation, or they’re pro-Israel and want to see Palestinian human rights, your voices have to be louder than these voices. And these people are saying that they love Israel, they’re supporters of Israel, but they’re also oftentimes white nationalist and white supremacist and it’s very confusing to progressives and particularly young progressives. They’re like, I don’t understand how you could be against white nationalism in America and white supremacy in America and want equality and justice in America and you’re fighting the fight here against the Trump administration, but then you support a government like Israel’s, which is engaging in nation state laws that also are creating a hierarchy of people based on faith. And in fact have similar, separate bus lines for people based on ethnicity and religion, and the way in which there are laws that talk about people that can’t get married because of who they are––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 An explicitly racialized caste system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. And so my question to people, and I think it’s important for them to think about what the answers are going to be, is that I understand there’s some sort of historical connection to the state of Israel that came after the Holocaust and safe homeland for Jews, and there’s a lot of that conversation that happens, but at the same time we have to be very unequivocal in saying this is not the Israel people imagined it to be, that we are going to create safety and security for one people at the expense of another people. And that is just not right any which way you try to explain it. And I think that’s the dilemma that people are getting into that the Trump administration has shined a light, in their partnership with the Netanyahu administration, and it’s putting our American Jewish family in a conundrum, and they really have to decide in the moment who they are, what they want to be, and also what was Israel supposed to be and what is it not? Because it’s not what they told us it was supposed to be. And for me, what’s been also happening, Daniel, you probably watched this video on a PBS show where Tamika Mallory was on the show. And she was supposed to be going to talk about Women’s March and the women’s agenda. And you know what happens, we go into these interviews and then people try to play a gotcha game with us.  And the gotcha game is out of nowhere; the lady comes out of nowhere and says, does Israel have a right to exist? And here is a Black woman that comes out of traditional Black organizing, she’s part of the Women’s March, she’s not an expert on the region, she’s not an expert on Israel-Palestine. She knows what’s happening there to Palestinians is wrong, which is majority of people, that’s just the basics. And so the other thing that I’ve been seeing is that those old gotcha moments are not working, and people are a lot more sophisticated and also people are a lot bolder. Like people like Marc Lamont Hill, who are saying look, I believe in a binational state. Israelis have a right to exist, Palestinians have a right to exist. They all have should have access to the basic needs that every human being should have access to, they should have one man, one woman, one vote. We should all be able to have the same employment based on our qualifications, not based on our race or ethnicity or religion. And I think the majority of people in America believe that. That if Israel is to be a democratic state, that everybody deserves to feel like they are part and can participate fully in a democratic society. So that’s another place where the very staunch pro-Israel movement is struggling right now, not just with Palestinians and others who are not Palestinian who are part of the Palestinian rights movement, but really amongst American Jews who are like, wait a minute, how are we asking for equal rights under the law in America, but then we’re not supporting that in a place like Palestine-Israel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Which is what’s so misleading about the question, does Israel have a right to exist? Because if you are a supporter of a secular binational state, as you are and as I am, and as many on the pro-Palestinian left are, which is a very basic, humane, progressive position that everyone be able to share one country in a non-ethnostate, that’s a very basic progressive baseline. But yes, it does presume that Israel as a Jewish state will no longer exist. But yes, Israelis have a right to exist and yes, Palestinians have a right to exist. That’s a different thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely, and I think that to conflate or to try to explain it, that’s not a position that progressives should hold because for some reason it means the destruction of Israel or Israeli people is misleading and it’s false. And that is not what anybody believes. I, as a person with a lineage to Palestinian people who are indigenous to the land, and there are some Jews who were indigenous to that land as well, Daniel. My grandmother was born in 1927 and was 21 years old when the state of Israel was created. And guess what? She said, Linda we lived with the Jews. We had Jews who were our neighbors. We lived peacefully with them, we would go to the market and they would be in the market with us selling whatever they grew in their gardens. She’s like, we always had a society where we lived together, where we respected each other and respected each other’s opportunity to exist in this land together. And at the time, I’m not clear if those Jews who lived at the time considered themselves to be Palestinian Jews and they may have, but the point is there has always been coexistence in Palestine. This is not a new thing that we’re asking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, the Arab-Israeli conflict is an export of European anti-Semitism via European colonialism to the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Mhm. And in fact even on a religious perspective, there is so much that we share as Muslims with Jews, in fact––we’re the closest, in fact, when it comes to the way in which we practice our faith. So my grandmother, who is a woman who has never had formal education, has told me this previously. She said, Linda, we always lived in peace with the Jews. We know it’s possible because we’ve done it before. We’ve been here before we have been able to live. And as someone, Daniel, who in the United States I am at the forefront of every fight in America, I do not like to see injustice. It keeps me up at night and I am a person who has decided to want to do something about it. Why would I be fighting for justice and the dignity and the sanctity of life in America but not fight for the dignity and sanctity of life in another part of the world like an Israel-Palestine. I don’t want to see Jews killed. I don’t want to see people who are descendants of the Holocaust have to go through another moment in time or history where there is historical trauma, which is why in America I step up every time something happens to Jews. Because I’m not a person that’s just going to tweet “Never Again” and just think that my little social media tweet is going to somehow stop anti-semitism from escalating to a point where something horrible is going to happen. We have to have action. We have to do tangible things. So that’s why for me, Daniel, it’s been very disheartening and it really actually hurts my heart and it hurts the hearts of many people in the progressive movement, particularly Palestinians who are always being called anti-semitic, like we see being labeled on people like Rashida and Ilhan, because we are anything but that. We are people who stand up for the rights of all people. I am a person that has proved over and over again that I’m not only ready to put my words out there, I’m ready to put my life on the line. And I will be the first person to protect Jews in America if God forbid we were ever going to be in a situation where something bad was going to happen, because I’m not going to let that happen on my watch and I don’t want that to happen on my watch in a place like Israel-Palestine either. And Daniel, I’ve been to Palestine. I just came from Palestine last summer. There is nobody in Palestine that I know that I’ve spoken to that doesn’t say we just want to have peace. We just want to be able to go to school. We just want to be able to work. We just want to be able to live with dignity here. There has never been a person that I’ve come across in Palestine that has said to me, Linda, the only way for Palestinians to live in peace is to destroy the state of Israel. It never happened. No one has ever said that, because that’s not what the Palestinian people want. They just want basic human rights, basic dignity, and in fact, the other thing that is never told, Daniel, is that inside of Israel, the amount of human rights activists who are Jewish and Israeli who are standing up boldly and loudly, saying end the occupation, end the illegal settlements in Palestine, is actually a lot bigger than people think because the media does not always want to portray the the actual pro-Palestine movement within Israel because it doesn’t help the narrative. And what I want people to know is that there are many organizations, many of which are led by Israeli Jews––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Like B’Tselem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Like B’Tselem, like groups that are like the refuseniks, and people that have decided not to serve in the Israeli military because they do not want to engage in in violation of human rights or don’t believe in the occupation. There are many organizations that bring Palestinians and Israelis together to work on peace projects, and so there is a lot of work that’s happened. There has been mass mobilization against the Netanyahu government and the way in which they have engaged in occupation of the Palestinian people. There have been mass protests against the nation state laws by all people across the spectrum in Israel. And I want people to know that exists, and this is not just an outside force telling Israel, stop violating the rights of Palestinians, but in fact there is a large movement within Israel asking the Israeli government to stop violating the rights of Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But that said, the politics in Israel have gotten pretty bad in recent years. And I see some parallels between what’s happening in the US with the rise of Trump and in Israel with the rise of Netanyahu, and the Israeli right as a whole. You know there’s this liberal myth in the US that Trump, with his Muslim ban, child separations, calling Mexican rapists, is this sharp break, out of the blue, from American history. It’s contrary to “who we are as a country.” And you see the same in Israel with Netanyahu in the citizenship law, which officially designates Arab Israelis as second-class citizens. In both cases, these right-wing politics are really the direct outcome of establishment politics as normal. They aren’t so much betrayals of what either the US or Israel really are, but rather these extreme and inevitable expressions of what those countries’ politics have looked like for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 What I want people to realize also is that while we’re having a conversation on Israel in the US and our relationships in Palestine, but the rise of the right is across the West and even in South America. I mean, when we saw the election in Brazil, people have to understand that this is becoming a worldwide phenomenon and crisis, and we have to really be consistent across the board––that Netanyahu is not right, Bolsanaro is not right, Trump is not right. We’re watching the rise of the right in places like Germany and other parts of Europe and we have to be able to stand across the board and say “absolutely not” and unite across country. This is why it’s important for us to understand as Americans that we cannot be American exceptionalists. We cannot just think that we live in this bubble called the United States of America and that things that happen outside of America do not impact us as a nation, particularly as a world power, that we have to pay attention to what’s happening. When Brexit was happening, people were like, well what does that have to do with me? When we watch the US relationship with Iran or with Turkey, people have to understand that these relationships and hopefully, we are people who are going to support diplomatic relationships because we have to also figure out how to pull ourselves away from this interventionist, let’s just get into wars everywhere we see some sort of crisis happening, and I think for me, people haven’t realized in America that what happened in Brazil, what’s happening in Europe, what’s happening in the rise of the right in Israel is all connected. These are not separate incidents. And if we don’t realize that now, something really bad is going to happen somewhere to a group of people and it’s going to happen on our watch and we’re going to say that we were aware of it but we were not prepared to do something because we were still having these petty political debates about partisanship and about who’s on what side. I just want people not to be on the side of white nationalism and I don’t want people to be on the side of extremist groups and people who want to create racialized caste systems and put some people over others. That’s what I want everybody to be against, and I think it’s something that everybody could agree on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well yeah, I mean I think it’s clearly an international issue. Look at Netanyahu cozying up to Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who is a brazen anti-Semite. But what they share is something more important, which is right-wing racism. The fact that Orbán is stoking anti-Semitism in Hungary doesn’t seem to bother Netanyahu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And those are the things that should be raising red flags for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right now, when we’re watching, for example, Congressman Lee Zeldin, who’s going after Ilhan Omar on Twitter, Lee Zeldin needs to go to a town hall with his constituencies in upstate New York. Leave a Muslim woman in a hijab who has… number one, she also has apologized for some tweet that she did in 2012, and she has a lot of staunch support from Jewish allies in Minnesota, she’s been great on policies and where she has stood on issues, and here you have a right-wing, Zionist member of Congress who’s engaging in harassment of a Muslim woman. I mean, our Jewish American family needs to say to him, this is not correct. This is not right. We have to hold everybody accountable, not just calling out people who may be engaging in anti-Semitism or anti-Semitic tropes but also those who are attacking and harassing women and women of color who may be from those camps. And so the thing that’s happening right now is there’s a lot of, anyone who supports Palestine or supports BDS is anti-Semitic, and there’s a lot of focus on “anti-Semitism in the left,” versus the powerful, influential anti-Semitism that is in the right. I saw somebody post something, Daniel, that I thought was really important and I thought was really profound. They said that the difference between anti-Semitism in the left and in the right is that in the left, when we have anti-Semitism it weakens us and it weakens our movements. But in fact in the right, it actually strengthens them. And I’m not going to lie to you, the left is not exclusive when it comes to issues of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and transphobia. These are conversations that have to be held often in the left. And it’s not across the left. It is particular individuals sometimes, maybe a group or two. Sometimes people have to get called in, because sometimes somebody may say something that they may not in fact realize could be seen as anti-Semitic or maybe an anti-Semitic trope. It’s sometimes, it’s really a lack of information or just misguidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But what you’re saying is that this is contrary to our values on the left, where on the right––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
––when this happens, this bolsters and reaffirms their values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. And in our movements, on the left, the Jewish community needs the left and the left needs the Jewish community. So there is no, “we can do this without our Jewish American family.” And I think what people are starting to realize now, and I think the question that lingers for a lot of Jewish Americans is, can you come and organize in a progressive movement that is a staunch critic of the state of Israel? And that’s really a dilemma for some people. And I tell people all the time, it’s not about coming to the movement and changing views of people who support Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions. It’s about finding common places that we can work together on issues of immigrant rights, on the issues of Black Lives Matter, criminal justice reform. And there may be a particular issue, Daniel, that we’re never going to agree on. And what I say to people all the time, and I say to this Democratic Majority for Israel, is that the progressive left has to understand this very important point: unity is not uniformity. I am in a movement and you are in a movement, Daniel, where we don’t agree with everybody. We have prison abolitionists, then people who want to do reform of the prisons. It doesn’t make anyone more or less than anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As long as we’re rowing in the right direction together, or the left direction as it were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. As long as we’re all rowing the right direction, some of us might want to get somewhere a little faster than others. But as long as we are all rooted in the same principles and values, we have to find ways to work together. So what I say to people is, don’t come to the table with any preconditions. And I say this to people all the time. When I go as a Palestinian American, as a light skinned Arab-American, Daniel, I do not go to tables that work on criminal justice reform and anti-police brutality and say to people, hey before I organize with you, before I share with you my resources and talents and skills, raise your hand if you believe in a free Palestine. That’s not how the movement works. You have to go build relationships. You have to put your skills up the table, you organize, you meet people. People start asking you, what’s your story, why are you here. You tell them who you are, where you come from. And then people start learning about who you are. They learn about what you care about, they start learning about and wanting to absorb information from you and potentially you’re able to win them to your side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because if politics was all about starting with everyone starting out on the same page together, we wouldn’t have to do politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. And that’s the thing that’s crazy. And the other thing that I always say to people, and I think one of the things that people are realizing right now in the progressive movement, particularly new progressive and new activists, is bullying doesn’t work, Daniel. If you have an argument to make about an issue, win me to that. Win me to your cause. And the way you’re going to win me to the cause is by appealing to my morals, my principles, and my convictions. And bringing me to that higher moral ground. If the way in which you’re going to try to win people to your cause is by silencing and stomping on and vilifying and dehumanizing your opposition, that’s not going to win people to your cause. People don’t respond well to bullying and that’s what’s been happening from the staunch pro-Israel side, is that they’ve been engaging in bullying tactics instead of trying to win people. If you want people to support the state of Israel, you go about and do that. If you have the arguments for it, if you have the talking points for it, you do what you gotta do. Go over there and try to bring as many people to your camp as possible. But if the only tactic you have is to silence pro-Palestinian voices and to dehumanize them, to threaten them, to try to get them fired from their jobs, to go after college kids on college campuses, to defame people in the media, it’s just not going to work. And it’s not working in the way that it worked 10 years ago, and that’s something that I think they’re realizing as well. And I’m proud of some elements of the progressive movement who have become a lot more vocal, including people like Dr. Michelle Alexander. I mean that was a big moment––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That op-ed was powerful. On the front of the Sunday Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And you know when you have a woman like a scholar, a world-renowned author and activist and a Black woman who says, look I’ve been silent too long. And actually admitted and recognized that one of the reasons why she felt like she couldn’t have spoken up earlier is in fact because of the ramifications of what happens to people when they become pro––when they are publicly or visibly pro Palestine––was really the sentiment that is shared across many people who have been afraid to speak up. I mean, the rescinding of the award to Angela Davis in Birmingham, Alabama, and obviously now they reinstated the award, because the progressive movement was like, no more. No more. And the reason why Angela Davis got her award rescinded was because she’s pro Boycott Divestment Sanction, and has been very clear about her support for the Palestinian people and ending the occupation and a binational state. And so this is not working anymore, Daniel. And I think I’m very proud to say that the progressive movement is building a really strong backbone that they hadn’t necessarily had in the same way maybe even five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Though we still have a long way to go. Look what happened to Marc Lamont Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Oh, absolutely. I mean absolutely. I think we do have a long way to go but I think even the type of conversations that the Marc Lamont Hill moment created was in of itself important. I always tell people look at the blessings of the dark moments, so when the Marc Lamont Hill happened, the amount of op-eds and people who came out in his defense, and the fact that he was able to maintain his position at Temple––obviously he was tenured––was important. And it really caused more people––like you have no idea how many people over the course of the last few weeks have reached out to me directly, saying to me, Linda, you’ve been right all along. You were absolutely right. Like I’d never even realized this and look what happened, why is this happening to Marc Lamont Hill, and then watching what’s been happening to Tamika Mallory as a Black woman, and then you watched what happened to Angela Davis, and then also the staunch opposition to Michelle Alexander. She was one of the untouchables; nobody touches Michelle Alexander. And a lot of the more liberal organizations, or at least the ones that are “liberal,” started basically criticizing Michelle Alexander. Which really has awoken in lot of our Black allies to say, wait a minute, something’s not right here and I want to read into this more, I want to understand this more, and if Michelle and Angela and Marc Lamont Hill, and Tamika and some other Black folks are on this issue, we really have to understand what’s going on here. And to be clear, there’s been a long legacy of Black solidarity with Palestine. In fact, Mama Ruby Sales, who was a civil rights icon, shared with me a statement written by SNCC in 1967, during the Arab-Israeli War, which almost destroyed their organization literally to smithereens, because of their support for the Palestinian people during their Arab-Israeli war. So we’re talking 55, more than 55 years ago. So Michelle Alexander and Tamika and Marc Lamont Hill are just part of a long legacy of Black allies and Black solidarity with the Palestinian people. And you’re going to see a lot more of that coming up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Let’s talk about some of the specific attacks on Tlaib and Omar. When the Senate took up the anti-BDS bill recently, Tlaib tweeted, “they forgot what country they represent.” And in response, Marco Rubio, the lead sponsor of the bill, accused her of anti-Semitic bigotry. He wrote, “this dual loyalty canard is a typical anti-Semitic line.” Democratic Representative Ted Deutch said that this was “classic anti-Semitism.” That all, of course, was absurd, because neither Rubio nor the other author of the bill, Joe Manchin, is Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. My thing Daniel is like, when you feel like something is anti-Semitic or something is offensive, people should speak up about it. We’re not telling people not to speak up. But when you’re going to make an argument that you’re offended by something and call it anti-Semitic, it has to be in fact anti-Semitic. So how could how could two people who are not Jewish, who are not Israeli citizens, how can we be talking about dual loyalty when they are not in fact Jews or Israelis? It doesn’t even make any sense. So that’s not the argument. That argument is used very often. It’s been used against me before, and I think what Rashida was really trying to say is that when you are a member of the US Senate, you are representing constituencies and you are representing the American people. So when you are supporting an anti-BDS legislation which is anti the Constitution of the United States of America, which you swore to uphold as a member of the US Senate, then Rashida has every right to question, who are you for? Who do you stand for? Who do you represent? And again, they are not Jews to claim that. Now, if someone who is Jewish said that I still don’t think that was the intent of Rashida anyway. But then that would have been a different conversation to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And what’s more, it is a fact that US politicians’ support for Israel is in no way aligned with the real interests of the American people. The only thing I would quibble with with Tlaib’s tweet is that the actions of the Israeli government aren’t in the real interests of the Israeli people either. Peace and justice for everyone is in everyone’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. And that’s what Rashida––that’s been her main point. She’s been saying this over and over and over again. She wants to see peace in the Middle East. I mean, her grandmother still lives there. The thing about it, Daniel, is our families still live there in the West Bank. And my family still lives out there. I was just with them this past summer. These are people who sometimes have water, sometimes they don’t. I mean, when I opened the shower in my grandmother’s house, if you just watch how the water comes down, it’s like literally dribble dribble. You can barely take a normal shower when you’re there.  When we hear about sometimes the electricity goes off in some of the refugee camps; I live in a village called Al Bida there, or my family lives in a village called Al Bida There’s a refugee camp literally in our backyard. And so what people have to understand is that these people just want to live in basic decency, basic security, just have basic dignity and be able to go to work, be able to take a shower, let their kids go to school continuously, not two weeks go to school and then three weeks you can’t go to school. And Rashida knows that and she has family members that she talks to often. They actually did a watch party for her when she was doing the swearing in ceremony. And Rashida is known, well-known, and the thing that happens here, Daniel, is they take us out of context of who we are. Rashida has been an activist for at least the past 17 years. She’s a woman that has jumped fences so she can get samples from local power plants to show that people in her community were being poisoned. This is a woman who stood up during Trump coming to Detroit and literally got dragged out by seven security guards, calling Trump a liar and all other kinds of things that he––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I interviewed her like a decade ago in southwest Detroit, when she was a state legislator, and had the same no nonsense, ass-kicking, left-wing community organizing thing going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, she has literally been the same person. And when you go to her district, Daniel, what a lot of people don’t know about Rashida is that, obviously everyone knows she’s Palestinian American, but do people know that she won in a district that’s 70% Black? That’s the demographic of the district that she won in. So she’s not a Palestinian Muslim woman who got her seat because of the Palestinians and the Muslims. She won a seat with a diverse electorate that has seen her dedicated work, particularly on environmental issues. So no one ever connects the dots that there could be a Palestinian Muslim American woman who just happens to be Palestinian, cares about Palestine-Israel, but her number one top priority issue is the environment. That’s really what she cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And environmental justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Environmental justice and immigrant rights. Those been her two main issues for the last 17 years that I’ve known her. Right, so that’s who she is. Same thing with Ilhan. If you look at Ilhan’s record both as an activist and also as someone in the state legislature, it is very clear who they are. They are pro-women, pro-LGBTQ, pro-immigrant. They are pro-unions. They are progressive in every sense of the word “progressive.” But what the media is trying to do to them, what other members of Congress who don’t agree with them, particularly on Palestine-Israel, is they’re trying to do what they do to us all the time. They want us to be in a box, so they don’t want us to be these intersectional whole human beings. She’s Palestinian. The only thing that we want to talk about when it comes to Rashida is Palestine and what her views are on Palestine. She in fact––just because we’re Palestinians, Daniel, doesn’t mean that we’re the most sophisticated when it comes to the political analysis of Palestine. Just because someone is of a particular nationality doesn’t make you an expert on Sudan, or if you’re Somali, on the state of affairs in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I could point to some white Americans who are not precisely experts on American politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. And so that’s the other thing that they’re trying to do to them. They’re putting them in these boxes and taking them away from what they’re really experts in and what they are the most sophisticated on, on issues that they’ve been working on when they were in the state legislature, like you said, environmental justice and immigrant rights is really what she’s very passionate about. But of course she’s passionate about Palestine. And Ilhan’s attacks have escalated because now Ilhan happens to be on the Foreign Relations Committee. And when she went on the Foreign Relations Committee, believe it or not, I really didn’t see Israel getting worried per se, but Saudi Arabia was probably like, oh no, here we go. Here we go. Ilhan Omar… because she said it, clearly. She said we got to stop arms deal sales to Saudi Arabia. So for me, it’s coming to terms with two women who are absolutely the most committed women you’ve ever met in your life. I know them both very personally and they get really hurt by these false accusations of anti-Semitism, which, fortunately, Daniel, haven’t really stuck for them, because I think people are really starting to see through the smoke screens and they see them for who they are. And these are women who are passionate and want to do the right thing and I think also, let’s remember they’ve only been there for a month for God sakes. Give the ladies a chance to breathe and a chance to actually vote on some things till we start saying whether they’re good, whether they’re bad, whether they’re good politicians or not good politicians. But I will say something about them. I won’t say if they’re good politicians or not but they are absolutely good, whole, wonderful women and we are very lucky to have them in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Turning to another first-year member of the House who has gotten more attention than anyone else. Ocasio-Cortez last year frustrated many when during an interview she seemed unable to clarify her position on the occupation. How did that incident play out with her many supporters, who are also strong supporters of Palestine, including you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think the other thing we have to also realize, Daniel, is that we in the progressive left have this issue sometimes where we do a lot of call out culture and not a lot of calling in. And I don’t like to engage in call out culture. I like to call people in and oftentimes a lot of the most transformative conversations happen privately. A lot of her supporters called her in and I think at that moment we have to remember, you know, she’s 28 years old at the time. She’s not exactly an expert on Palestine-Israel or any Middle Eastern politics. Let’s just be clear, that’s just the facts, right. She knows the fundamentals, that there’s human rights violations that are happening there. She was very clear in a tweet about what was happening during the Great Return March and the massacres happening against protesters, and she similarly for me was in the same boat as Tamika Mallory, in the sense that a lot of great passion and commitment and conviction, but not a lot of details and information. Because that’s just not their issue. So for me, my role is to really have those conversations with her and have other pro-Palestine, Palestinian activists and organizers, including members of Justice Democrats and the Democratic Socialists of America, and people just having conversations, people sending her articles to read, different kind of takes from different groups that we deem to be fair and just on this issue. And so for me it’s all about education, and I think the frustration comes because we expect so much from these women. And that’s another thing that we have to be really careful about, Daniel, is that we have such a minimal number of progressives that went into Congress and we are really sitting back with very high, high, high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 For a very small number of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 For a very small number of people. And even though we’re like, yeah we got all these progressives in there, but when you look at 137 members of Congress and actually counting who the true progressives are, we’re still in a very, very small minority. And so what I say to people all the time is when you see some of these women in particular who may sometimes say things maybe not in the way that you would say them or where you feel uncomfortable with something that they said, I highly recommend that you drop them an email. And I believe wholeheartedly that Ilhan, Rashida, and Alex’s campaign are reading these emails, and in fact, they are responding to thoughtful people and people who are really seeking answers or seeking clarifications. And so what I also say to people is let’s wait for people to vote, and see how people are going to legislate their work. I believe in my heart that Alex knows that there’s an occupation in Palestine. I believe in my heart that Alex believes that there are human rights violations that are happening to the Palestinian people. I believe that she’s against illegal settlements in Palestine. And I also believe that she will uphold the rights of all Americans to engage in BDS. I don’t know if she’s a supporter of BDS, but I do know that she will be someone that will never legislate against the constitutional rights of Americans. So I say to people, let’s lower our expectations a little bit. Not too much, because I don’t want to be too low in my expectations, but I think when we put our expectations so high in these very few number of women, we’re gonna be disappointed and we’re gonna be disappointed a lot. And I don’t like to be disappointed, but I think we should be calling people and emailing and calling people when we feel like they’ve said something that makes us uncomfortable. Versus the harassing people on Twitter and calling people sellouts before you’ve gotten all the information. Because the other thing that I think, Daniel, is they’re already being harassed. I’m sure you watch the timelines of Ilhan, Rashida, and Alex. I mean they are absolutely––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s vicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Vicious. And I also welcome people on the progressive left to also thank people when they do the right thing. When you see Ilhan or Rashida or anybody, Ayanna Pressley, or Jahana, or any of these women saying something that you agree with, I want you to go on their social media and say, “thank you so much for speaking out. I agree with you. Thank you so much. Great. Lucky to have you.” Because they need to have their morale boosted too. They’re still human beings that went in there. I mean, these are women––Ilhan has children, Rashida has children. Recently Rashida’s sister was being harassed; she had posted something about that. And so we have to understand there is a toll that’s being taken on these women and that we need to continue to hold them, as an extension of the progressive movement. Give them some expectations, but also not put our expectations so high that they will eventually disappoint us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This is something that the left needs to learn. We’re so used to being out of power in this country that now that we have some real champions in Congress, we, as you say, need to distinguish between calling out and calling in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. I mean, it’s even happened to me before. The other thing also, Daniel, is we’re all flawed human beings. We’re all going to mess up along the way, we’re all going to say something sometimes, or hopefully it’s one time and one time only and you never make the same mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Have a bad take on something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, have a bad take, have a bad position on something. Or sometimes people really believe that they have a…like for example, I’ve been watching people talking about Venezuela. Some people have really problematic views on it but at the same time I know it’s coming from a good place. So you have to sometimes call people in and say, hey, I see what you’re trying to say but let’s have a bigger conversation. Let me connect you to some Venezuelan activists and you can kind of see what’s going on here. So I always say to people all the time is that let’s not have too much high expectations of each other in the kind of progressive left, and that we call each other in in those moments. And more specifically on this issue that we’ve been talking about, Daniel, particularly on Israel-Palestine, one of the things that I ask across the progressive left is something that we can all agree on is that we have to defend people who are victims of false accusations of anti-Semitism and say to people, look, you don’t have to agree on this issue but I’m not going to stand for it, for you calling Ilhan or Rashida anti-Semites. It is unacceptable to call Linda anti-Semitic for her views on Palestine, or for Marc Lamont Hill, or for Angela Davis. The more that we on the progressive left start standing up for each other and build a kind of network of support it really will deter folks in the opposition to go against us in the same way that they are. The reason why there’s such vitriolic hate and consistent hate against these women is because the progressive left doesn’t have the same apparatus, right. We don’t hit back as hard as they hate us and so they see a lot of these women of color as very vulnerable, and the last thing that we need is vulnerable women of color leaders in the progressive left. And I call on our friends and our allies and our supporters, particularly on this issue, to really stand up and say, look, we can discuss the details and the politics and the different views, but we’re not going to stand for people being called anti-Semitic. Because what it does is it actually is a disservice to our Jewish family, because we need to be able to to distinguish real anti-Semitism from critiquing the state of Israel because people’s lives actually depend on us understanding real anti-Semitism, so that we’re ready to respond when real anti-Semitism is either coming within our movement, or it’s being manifested in the society around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As we saw last year in Pittsburgh. But we’re certainly not seeing that sort of defense of just the basic dignity of these two members from some people in the Democratic establishment. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, “I don’t know that I draw the conclusion that these two members are anti-Semitic.” What a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. It’s like what? What are you talking about? It should be an unequivocal, I don’t agree with them sometimes, but they are absolutely not anti-Semitic, is really the kind of response. These tepid responses actually sometimes could be dangerous because it leaves things up for question. It may mean that someone actually might have had a doubt in their heart, you know what I mean, and I think we need to be able to say, these women are unequivocally not anti-Semitic. There is nothing in their records that indicates that and we want to make sure that we do not equivocate critique of the state of Israel, support of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movements with anti-Semitism, because it absolutely is not. And we have to also distinguish from saying that there may be one or two or a few people in the left that may be in fact anti-Semitic, right. But we as the progressive left are not an anti-Semitic group or a movement, because that’s just inaccurate and false. And I am committed to, and many people in the progressive left are committed to, I am committed to calling out anti-Semitism in the progressive left. And I’ve done it many times before. I did a speech at the Left Forum in 2017 and I said to people, hey hey, we are not exclusive of the ills we claim to fight against in the opposition. We also got to clean our house too, and sometimes our house has anti-Semitism, sometimes it has anti-Black racism and homophobia and transphobia and Islamophobia. And we have to be able to stand up to that and I’m willing to do that and I know a lot of people on the progressive left are too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Now returning to our discussion of AOC, she’s now being attacked for having had a friendly phone call with Jeremy Corbyn, which should have not come as a big shock given that she’s one of the most famous leftists the United States right now and Jeremy Corbyn is the left-wing leader of the UK’s opposition party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, and I was watching some of the responses to her particular tweet about that. I mean, listen, this is a woman who’s a member of Congress and is having diplomatic discussions with another very important leader in another country. I mean, Jeremy Corbyn is a flawed leader, but he’s a great leader. And is there anti-Semitism, like we talked about earlier in the West, absolutely in Europe? Absolutely. In the UK? Absolutely. But you know what, Jeremy Corbyn has been clear and unequivocal. He’s made statements, he’s put out videos, and he’s also not responsible for everybody that is part of the Labour Party. And not to say that there aren’t people who have been quite problematic and have said very problematic things. But this general attack on someone like AOC to speak to Jeremy Corbyn, is like, really people? Like you never spoke to a leader somewhere that may have said something or you may think is something that we maybe don’t agree with or don’t align with? This double standard that we are putting on these women of color is absolutely outrageous. We do not do it to anybody else. I never heard anybody questioning any white man member of Congress about a phone call that they had with somebody out of nowhere. I mean, Jeremy Corbyn is a progressive leader. Many of the policy issues that the Labour Party stands for are very aligned with the things that we are fighting for here in this country. Now, some members may be problematic, but their platform unequivocally rejects anti-Semitism and homophobia and Islamophobia and all these types of things. And so for me, I was just like, I hope that AOC doesn’t go down that route, where she feels like she’s gonna be bullied into not speaking to certain people because it makes some people feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There was a response that she and her chief of staff had on Twitter that I think worried some people, reaching out to a pro-Israel activist who had complained, but my presumption is that they are just being diplomatic to a constituent, and not that they’re about to capitulate and say we’re never gonna talk to Jeremy Corbyn again. But we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 No. Yeah, no, absolutely. And I think it’s fair to say that, as a member of Congress, you should speak to everyone. I don’t think that members of Congress would just speak to the people who voted for them, or speak to just the constituents that they think that agree with them. We should be speaking to all of our constituents, everyone from the left to the right, and should be able to have those hard conversations. But you know, you got to stand your ground, maintain your principles and conviction, but I absolutely support AOC speaking to anyone who is her constituent. And that was my thing when I saw that it was a constituent I was like, that’s cool with me. But when you’re not a constituent and you want to try to influence someone, there’s a slippery slope there for me, and I think that AOC is a very brilliant young woman, I think she has a brilliant team, and I think that they know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Looking ahead at 2020, the Democratic presidential primary, it seems to me that foreign policy in general and Palestine in particular could be big sleeper issues. There are so many establishment types who are rushing to present themselves as progressives who, on a policy level, are indistinguishable from Bernie Sanders. They’re not indistinguishable but that is going to be how they attempt to present themselves. And I think it will be key for Bernie, if he runs, for both political and obviously moral reasons, to heighten and emphasize his criticisms of the US foreign policy establishment. It seems, given his recent strong criticisms of Israel in the last few years, and his taking a lead role in the push to end support for the Saudi war on Yemen, that he might be thinking just that. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, it’s one of the reasons I support Bernie Sanders, it’s why I supported him back in 2016. It’s because I need him in the race to push everybody else to the left, and really to have people reckon with questions that they may not otherwise have to reckon with. If we did not have a person with the type of ideological leanings that Bernie Sanders has––Bernie Sanders is an anti-interventionist. He is very vocally anti-war, and specifically recently, when it came to the war in Yemen. It really has pushed a lot of his colleagues, some of whom may not have ever went down that route, to vocally oppose with the resolution to end our support for a Saudi-led war in Yemen. And also when it comes to Palestine, if you have watched him over the time when the Great Return March was in the media and was kind of at the height of it, he put out multiple videos, like his people were on it. It wasn’t just a one time thing; he was centering voices of people from Gaza in these videos. He’s been very critical of the policies of the state of Israel and it’s very important for a voice like his, and I’ll say, also, because he is a Jewish American senator, his voice is even more critical in this moment. And it allows for Jewish Americans to be empowered to say that I am not a self-hating Jew because I stand up for the human rights of all people, including the Palestinian people, in fact, that is in fact what my Judaism centers and tells me to do, is to stand up for justice for all people. So for me, Bernie Sanders is a very critical voice in this next election and I hope he does decide to run because on this particular issue, foreign policy, he brings a very important voice to the table in a way. And to your point, Daniel, let’s be clear: everyone’s running around here talking about Medicare for All and debt-free college and all these other different policy platforms, and environmental justice, the bottom line is, just a few years ago, when we were all on the Bernie Sanders campaign, everyone said we were naive. And everyone said that we were politically naive, that we were idealistic, and we were running with some pie in the sky, and here we are, just a few years later, two years later, where we as a movement, not Bernie by himself, but we as a movement have been able to mainstream ideas like Medicare for All, like debt-free and free college tuition, like issues around environmental justice, like issues like Palestine-Israel, mainstream them in a political way because of having a man who decided to give his platform to the most progressive of the progressive in this country. So I’m hoping that he runs. Bernie Sanders’ participation in the primary is necessary because of his views on foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 My other thought in that is that having a Jewish president, who is the first Jewish president of the United States, who is also staunchly pro-Palestinian would transform not only American politics but also global politics, including by striking a huge blow against anti-Semitism, because it would send a strong message that Netanyahu does not speak for the world’s Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Bernie Sanders is a Brooklyn-born, Jewish American. I grew up with people like Bernie, and I love Bernie, and I think in a time of rising anti-Semitism in America it would be poetic justice for us to put the first Jewish American president in the White House. But not only will he be the first Jewish American president who is pro-Palestine and truly progressive, he will be bringing the movement with him to the White House. I know that for a fact, Daniel, and that’s what I want people to think about as they go in to 2020. And I want people in the primary to support whomever they want in the primary and once we get out of that primary, I need everybody to get in line. And I know that people don’t like to hear that, but really right now we’re in a fight against fascism. This is not lesser of two evils. This is fascism. “Are we going to take out fascism or are we not?” is the question for me. But when it comes to Bernie Sanders, I always dream of what a Bernie Sanders administration or a very progressive, liberal left administration looks like. And it actually brings tears to my eyes. And I would love as a Muslim American activist and one of the most visible Muslim American activists in this country to say that I was alive at the time when we put in the first Jewish American president in the White House and I want to have everything to do with that. And really for me it gives me chills that that could be a possibility at a time, in the darkest moments that we’ve seen, at least in my generation, of rising anti-Semitism across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, Linda Sarsour, thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LS:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thank you so much, Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Linda Sarsour saw is a Brooklyn-born, Palestinian Muslim American activist and organizer. She’s the co-founder of Empower Change, the first Muslim-founded and led online organizing platform and a national organizer with the Women’s March. Thank you for listening to The Dig from Jacobin Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two left-wing Muslim women newly elected to Congress—Palestinian-American Rashida Tlaib and Somali-American Ilhan Omar—are resetting the Congressional debate over Palestine. In response, they have been met with slanderous attacks. On the one hand, this is exciting: we’ve never had people in Congress not only criticizing Israeli brutality but also supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. On the other hand, the current debate is a sobering reminder of how amongst American elected officials, overwhelming, and nearly unconditional, bipartisan support for Israel remains the norm even as Democratic voters move leftward—and in increasing opposition to the occupation. Dan speaks to organizer Linda Sarsour on the politics of Palestine in flux—and how partisan polarization on the issue is accelerating, and why that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Velasco, Gabriel Hetland and Naomi Schiller on the profound economic, social, and political crisis in Venezuela. More than three million refugees and migrants have fled the country. Opposition figure Juan Guaidó has declared himself president. Trump and other right-wing leaders throughout the Americas quickly recognized him as just that. The US imposed new sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and has hinted at the possibility of a military invasion. It’s unclear what comes next, but foreign intervention would make an extremely bad situation catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many reactionaries throughout the Americas are pointing to Venezuela as proof that socialism cannot work. What is the correct analysis? What does solidarity with the Venezuelan people mean for today’s left? These are all extremely complicated and urgent questions. Today, Dan interviews three experts on Venezuela to help answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, a leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, is on trial in New York. After twice making his way out of Mexican prisons, he was extradited to the United States. This is what counts as a major victory in the never-ending US war on drugs, which the US has in recent decades exported to Mexico. Yet El Chapo’s arrest, like that of so many others, has done nothing to stop Mexican drug cartels from continuing to export massive quantities of cocaine and heroin and other drugs. Neither has it caused cartels to pause the murderous bloodbath that they have visited upon the Mexican people. The Mexican state continues to be a corrupt one, and the domestic deployment of a Mexican military deeply implicated in human rights violations is set to continue. And there is still no justice for the disappeared students from Ayotzinapa. Dan interviews legendary Mexican investigative journalist Anabel Hernández.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Democracy is the proposition that the people should govern themselves. But who are the people, and how should they govern?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The teacher strike wave continues as more than 30,000 members of United Teachers Los Angeles walk picket lines not only for the higher wages that they deserve but also for the well-funded and great schools that the city’s working-class students of color have long been systematically denied—a situation that has been exacerbated by a corporate reform-led school board and superintendent dead-set on privatizing the district. UTLA has in recent years been led by a militant, rank-and-file caucus that has shunted aside the old guard’s narrow vision of service unionism in favor of a big-picture movement unionism that makes the struggles of teachers, parents and students one on and the same.

   <link href="http://localhost:4000//transcripts/transcript-astra-taylor-on-democracy"/>
   <updated>2019-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/transcripts/transcript-astra-taylor-on-democracy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/astra-taylor-on-democracy/&quot;&gt;Listen to Episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Denvir:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Dig, a podcast from Jacobin Magazine. My name is Daniel Denvir and I’m broadcasting from Providence, Rhode Island. What is democracy? It’s a very good question, but one that too few in the political establishment bother to ask. Instead, they simply warn that democracy, which they self-servingly conflate with the pre-Donald Trump status quo, is under threat from Donald Trump. Trump of course threatens all sorts of things, but too often what establishment figures mean by a threat to democracy is a threat to American political norms and institutions. What establishment scolds either can’t or won’t acknowledge is that those institutions and norms, waging wars on drugs and terror, facilitating the massive transfer of wealth to the superrich, plundering the planet, and constructing a national security state deportation machine and horrific system of mass incarceration are so often themselves fundamentally anti-democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode is an interview with filmmaker Astra Taylor about her new philosophical documentary,What Is Democracy?,
which asks ordinary people and political philosophers alike just that. The answers are often extraordinary and far more incisive than the mindless pablum that emanates from Washington and its official interpreters. Also, I’m not conducting this interview––political scientist and Jacobin editor Alyssa Battistoni is.What is Democracy?
opens in New York on Wednesday, January 16th––in other words, today, the day that I’m posting this interview, at the IFC Center, before traveling to theatres and campuses. Many special guests will be on hand during opening week in New York for live Q&amp;amp;As with Astra, including Silvia Federici, Cornel West, and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details, go to www.ifccenter.com/films/what-is-democracy. Those of us who don’t live in New York can find other dates through the distributor, Zeitgeist Films, and if you want to bring this film to your school or town––and you really should––please contact Zeitgeist Films before we move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m moving to Santiago, Chile for three months in a few days. My partner, political scientist Thea Riofrancos, has fieldwork to conduct on the politics of lithium mining––lithium being a key component in the renewable energy transition. But have no fear: I found a studio in Santiago and the podcast will continue and will definitely include at least one show on Chilean politics. If you live in Chile, please hit me up. Also, many of the questions that today’s show wrestles with will be taken up again next week in an interview on populism with Thea and political scientist Laura Grattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s get going. Astra Taylor is a filmmaker, writer, and organizer. She is the director of the philosophical documentariesWhat Is Democracy?, Examined Life, 
andŽižek!.
She is the author of the American Book Award winnerThe People’s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age
, and a co-founder of the Debt Collective. Her new book,Democracy May Not Exist But We Will Miss It When It’s Gone
, will be out for Metropolitan Books on May 7th. Alyssa Battistoni is a PhD candidate in political science at Yale University and an associate faculty member at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research. She writes frequently for publications including The Nation, n+1, Dissent, and Jacobin, where she is on the editorial board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alyssa Battistoni:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Astra Taylor, welcome to The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astra Taylor:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s great to have you on. And I wanted to start off by saying how much I love your film, 
What Is Democracy? I’m a political theorist so I am very much the audience for it. But I think what’s so great about it is that it’s not a film for academic political theorists, it’s a film that takes these big questions that I think often just get asked, or are sort of thought of as asked by academics or in academic political theory and poses them to everyone. And I’m teaching an intro political philosophy class right now and the questions that we’re talking about every week are the questions that you’re asking in the film: who should rule, what is democracy, do we live in one? And it’s really incredible to see a film bringing these questions out of the classroom and into the public, which is where I think they should be. So it’s really incredible and rich and moving and beautiful and I want everyone to see it, so everyone go see it when you can. I’m going to start with a couple of questions about making the film and then wanted to get more into the questions. So questions about the questions film was posing. So first off, could you just tell me more about how you came to make this specific film and ask this question, what is democracy? Because there’s a point early on in the film where you say that you weren’t sure what it was going to be about exactly, but you kept coming back to the question of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Let’s begin with democracy. Because I personally even wrestled a bit with making this the theme of the film. But I kept returning to democracy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Great, great. All right great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So you’re almost a metaphor for our problem, which is, on the one hand, democracy is this totally fluid and stretchable notion today. It can be appropriated by anybody for anything. It has been appropriated for terrible purposes: for imperialism, for colonial conquest, for smashing unions, for undoing affirmative action. All kinds of things happen in the name of democracy that you might object to, that I might object to, and it has many possible forms but then we think, okay, so let’s get away from it, let’s have something else. Let’s go to a different form for understanding justice or for centering our own projects of freedom, equality, emancipation, just living, inclusion, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So I was wondering when you started thinking about this. It certainly feels very timely, but when did this start percolating? How did you develop it into this particular focus and question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 First, thanks for the kind introduction. It makes me really happy to hear that someone who is an expert in political theory enjoys this and thinks the film works and that a film that follows these theoretical ideas out into the world is worth doing, because it’s not the most intuitively cinematic concept, right? There aren’t that many philosophy films, sadly, especially not in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So you’re leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, I kind of have the genre cornered, I guess, which is sort of funny. I mean the question of what is democracy is something that came to me while I was involved in Occupy Wall Street of 2011. And there was the wave of social movements, not just in the United States, right, so in Spain, in Greece, the Arab Spring. And all of these movements were united by this word, regardless of their political context or what they were railing against. Yeah and I don’t want to be harsh but there was also a lot of dysfunction in Occupy and there were these general assemblies that were in theory open to everybody; it was trying to practice direct democracy and then they would break down and people would fight. I remember one night I saw somebody get punched and I was thinking, I think we could use a bit of political theory here. We know what we’re against, but let’s go back to basics. I was also thinking at the time a lot about the Internet because I wrote a book called 
The People’s Platform, that’s a political economy of the Internet. And so I was basically debunking Silicon Valley claims of democratizing everything. It was the heyday of “we’re democratizing media, we’re democratizing culture, we’re democratizing your laundry.” It’s funny now––it’s funny sad––because we’ve gone from this ridiculous Silicon Valley techno-utopianism to this very dystopian view that now social media has played a big role in destroying our democracy––if we ever had one. So the word was on my mind and I wrote a proposal for the film and I just thought, okay I’ll just use this very simple question just as a sort of lodestar, just to keep this inquiry at the top of my mind. And I thought at different points that I would come up with a better title, but I’ve settled on it because I think it for me it’s really important that the question is there because that’s what the philosophical mode is: it’s questioning, it’s unsettling, it’s trying to challenge our presuppositions and it would be ridiculous to imply that I could somehow answer that question in a 90-minute movie. So by the end I was like, okay that’s actually the right question. But I imagined, like a lot of people, that the film would come out under sort of neoliberal Clinton administration, in a different political context than the one we’re in. So what’s interesting to me about showing the film at this moment is that whereas I thought that I would be engaging with the sort of culture in a very complacent moment and trying to jolt it, this is not democracy. The film actually is serving a different role because we’re actually now in this moment of political crisis and turmoil and there’s so much fear. We’re so caught up in the reaction, reacting to every comment that Trump makes. And so the film, it does something very different. It creates this more reflective mood. And it’s actually a no, step back and think. And the film has this very expansive time horizon, going back 2500 years, and it’s like we’ve never had democracy and democracy certainly didn’t die in November of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, absolutely. It’s really interesting to hear that you were thinking it would come out in, maybe a Clinton administration or something, because I think obviously the moment we’re in is one where we’re constantly seeing these headlines, like “democracy in crisis,” that democracy is in trouble around the world, but sometimes you wonder whether we’re all operating with the same understanding of democracy or what the threat to democracy is, where it’s coming from, and so on. The film really is great for this taking a step back from all those headlines and thinking about the questions underneath and, I mean, I think the question works so well because you’re posing it to philosophers as you’ve talked to philosophers in previous films and people who are sort of, I guess recognized as academic philosophers in some way or professional philosophers, and you’re bringing in canonical thinkers, and Rousseau and Plato and going back as you said, 2500 years, but of course, also talking to “ordinary people” and asking genuinely and seriously, what is democracy and what do you make of this? And I think one of the things that I really like so much about what the film is, that it’s doing this work to compose a public and bring people together as a philosophical community and a political community. And it’s very democratic and the ethos of saying, you can talk to a lot of different people and they can have ideas about these big questions, it’s quietly a rebuke to Plato, who thinks the masses can’t philosophize. And so you know, you’re talking to this huge range of people, from Guatemalan immigrants who run a worker-owned co-opm and school kids in Miami, and Syrian refugees in Greece, and people who have served in office and people who have maybe never voted, and kind of everyone in between, and they all have really interesting and insightful things to say about democracy. They certainly don’t always agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian Guerrier from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 If we are going to struggle to make a better world, a more democratic world, we all first must agree that all lives has equal values. Once we all agree on that, I think we can definitely stretch the concept of democracy. To me, I just see another historical moment that we are in, where we can either live together forward, or we can go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor On-Sang from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think it’s really important, when talking about democracy, especially in Miami, being a global city full of immigrants, who gets to be a citizen, right? And who gets this global citizenship? Who’s able to be mobile and what’s able to be mobile? Zygmunt Bauman said that mobility in late modernity it is a lot more important than capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So one of the things that I thought about [while] watching, was that I was wondering how you thought about composing this set of people, or whose voices you wanted to have in the film, how you went about bringing those people into it, and how you went out looking for the people you wanted to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, I mean it’s interesting, because you’re a political theorist, and that’s your expertise. I think one thing that’s really interesting about political theory is that it’s this in-between discipline, because it’s not pure philosophy. It’s not metaphysics or something that’s in a traditional philosophy department. But it’s also not a science. It’s not totally empirical or just, studying the facts on the ground. It’s in this in-between space and the film tries to occupy that in-between space. I mean, political theory, in my view, is something that everyone should have access to and I think the film does try to make the case that people are far more thoughtful than we give them credit for. So I really tried in every conversation I had to approach the person I was talking to as though they were a philosopher. And so that’s part of this egalitarian ethos that I think is really at the heart of the movie and how I approached the people I met, and the people I was really interested in. And I was quite impressed by how people rose to the occasion. I mean I didn’t know when I conceived this––okay, I had this idea in my mind, I’m going to go and talk to “regular people” like they’re philosophers, but actually so much brilliance came my way and so much insight about the world that we inhabit. And I think part of that is that people who occupy society’s bottom rungs really understand how society works and have a lot of interesting observations. So these school kids in Miami, they’re 12 to 14 years old, but they really see the way the apparatus of school functions and how decision-making is structured to keep people like them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astra Taylor from 
What is Democracy:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The idea of democracy is that the people rule. And so that’s one thing I want to talk to you guys about is, how do you feel? Do you feel like you have a say in your school? Is that a place where you feel like you have any say over how things go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student One from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think we don’t have a say because it’s run by people bigger than us and bigger than the school. Like, it’s a whole county, so I don’t think we really have a say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Two from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Whatever rules they establish, we just gotta follow, so it’s nothing else we can say to defend ourselves, we just gotta do whatever they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astra Taylor from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Is democracy something you talk about in school and that you’ve learned about in history classes, and stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student One from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Two from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s like about government, like different branches. They don’t ask us, oh, so how do you feel about the school?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astra Taylor 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Does anybody ever think about school being another way? Like could you imagine a school where the students actually had some sort of seat at the table and were allowed to have a vote or voice in things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student One from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 People inside of the school should have something to say but it’s really not going to matter, because, like I said, there’s other people ruling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That was an encouraging takeaway, I think, from making this film. But I did think a lot about this question that you’re raising, which is, who is the demos of the film? And one insight that kind of stayed with me through the filming process was the fact that part of what makes democracy challenging intellectually is that “the people” is an abstraction. I mean, the idea of the democratic people is an invention, right. This idea of a social body that should have popular sovereignty. It’s not clear who “the people” are. It’s not something that you can just point to. And so I wanted to show a people that didn’t have any illusion of wholeness. You know not like an ethnonationalist people. It’s a conflicted people. It’s a people that’s not always pretty and it’s also a people that’s agitating, that is fighting to exist. But again, I’m working within the boundaries of a movie; it can’t be 20 hours long. So I also just needed to convey there needed to be enough people that it felt representative and that it felt open enough, that it was okay that I left out all of these other kinds of people who aren’t in the film. So that was also a tricky balance because we were in a moment where representation is really important. And there are like 30 or 40 people in the movie, but there are so many types of types of people who aren’t in there. So that was tricky, like when did it feel like I had enough? The film feels like it is a legitimate expression of the demos. But I think that the subject of democracy is really; it worked in the documentary format because it’s a medium where you can really have that polyphony, and you get the sort of polyphony of voices and characters and they kind of augment each other’s perspectives and add different insights. I work a lot as a writer and I wouldn’t be able to capture on the page their individuality and their magic or their perspectives. But a documentary is the form to show human beings and tell their stories. So I think it was a really good medium for this project. But I think what this film does that’s a bit unique is that it doesn’t just stay with the personal. It doesn’t just present human interest stories. It doesn’t give you a narrative catharsis. It’s all about, okay, yes, there are individuals, but there’s the structural. There’s the personal and there’s the political and so I’m always trying to move between those two registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, and everyone is conveying where they’re coming from and who they are, but also they’re weighing in on these questions. I mean it feels to me, at points, political theory from below or something, or it’s what you’re saying about the documentary being a good form for a film about democracy makes sense because it really is. It’s like watching democracy in action or something. But not just in the sense of watching people voting, you’re just watching people work through ideas on screen, which is really cool. I was wondering how you’re thinking about this question of what democracy looks like and there’s that chant, you know, this is what democracy looks like. I have chanted that chant many times and I enjoy it––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I have too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’m sure we both have, possibly at the same events. And I always think democracy looks like a lot of things. There are a lot of ways a democracy looks and I think you see a lot of them in the film but I wonder how you thought about the image of democracy or what, literally, democracy looks like when you’re when you’re watching it on screen and in this visual sense. You have both these in the film, it’s very intellectual, there are a lot of ideas, a lot of conversation and dialogue, but it’s a film, so you’re also watching it. So how did you think about how to portray democracy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 That is a really good question and I love that because I feel like part of the motivation for the film was actually that I kind of reached a limit and I’d gotten to the point where when I was at a protest and I heard that chant I was like, “I hope not.” We have to go beyond these little tiny marches that I’ve been to a million times. So that chant was definitely on my mind. There are some obvious visual motifs that aren’t in the film. There’s stuff that is not there. You don’t see the White House. You actually don’t see people voting. I mean, voting rights are discussed, but you don’t see people casting ballots. So there are some conventional tropes of democracy that we left out purposefully. And it’s quite hard to find examples of what to me would be true democracy in action. So there are some small-scale examples. There’s Occupy Greece. There’s some footage of that in a montage. There’s a very fascinating, as you mentioned, workers co-op which is one of the last textile factories in North Carolina. All of these factories have been devastated by NAFTA. And there’s one left and it’s actually run by immigrants as a democratic co-op. There’s a democratically-run health clinic in Greece. And one thing I struggled with was that I’m not someone who only thinks democracy can work at the small level. I’m not “a small is beautiful” person. But those are sort of the credible examples that I could find and felt that I could really feature in the film and and feel like they were legitimate examples. Well, also the people in those spaces are very aware of the limitations. The other big thing I think in terms of representing democracy is the issue of dialogue. So a big tradition is, of course, deliberative democracy, and what you see in the film is there’s a lot of conversation and a lot of not just talking, but listening, in the film. It’s a funny thing for this visual medium to be focused on, but the film is not just image. It’s also sound. And so there’s people talking and there’s people listening and a lot of time there’s me listening. And I think the film is structured so that the audience is on a journey with me. I’m posing questions, I’m guiding the inquiry, but a lot of the time I’m listening really intently and I sometimes feel like listening doesn’t get its due and a big part of this film is making the case for a sort of politics of listening: who is listened to, who is regarded as an expert, who is taken seriously. And that’s why it is so important for me to put a 12-year-old girl next to a quote from Plato. And challenge this idea of who an expert is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And asking people who have not been asked what they think about things maybe ever, or maybe asked what they think about something that they then won’t actually have any influence over, or that their answer won’t have any meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But I do think that one scene that is really important to me, and people haven’t picked up on it as much––because there is a divide in the film in the sense that there are non-academics, and then there are figures like Wendy Brown and Cornel West and Silvia Federici. And so there can seem to be this really stark division between the philosophers and the people. But there’s this one character who’s a Greek classicist and she talks about the origins of the word “democracy” in Athens, and we go to the Agora together and there’s this scene where you finally go into her house and you see that her daughter has had to emigrate because she has no future in Greece, in the wake of the economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspesia Balta from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 If I would be needed there, to help––all of my classmates are leaving. Almost no one is staying. We need to have a chance at this life. It’s very difficult for me to leave Greece. And that’s actually a bit like ethical dilemma for me, that if some of us then hope, will change…. Are you crying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efimia Karakantza from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes, of course I’m crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspesia Balta from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I hope politically that one day I will be able to come, to come back, that the political situation will be better and the European situation will better, so I will be able to come back and help the place that I know so much about, and that I love so much about, and that I have pained so much for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And so to me that scene is meant to say, there really isn’t a separation. There aren’t people who just live detached from political problems––intellectuals are people too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah absolutely and in some ways it sort of reflects what you get to at the end, when you’re talking to Silvia Federici about democratizing reproduction and bringing politics into reproduction and not just looking at politics as something that happens in the “public sphere”––that it happens in a lot of places. I hadn’t thought about it until now, but that’s a great moment of seeing that, in someone’s home, watching this woman who’s been talking about the history of Greek democracy and about these big philosophical concepts, and her crying speaking to her daughter, who is in another country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I mean I tried to actually put those scenes closer together so that that connection would be more explicit. And because I locked myself into this mode, or I chose to make the film in such a way that there’s a lot of implicit meaning––I didn’t have a sort of big red arrow that’s like, hey, this is the part about seizing the means of production, or this is the part about the fact that she’s also a person and not just a brain. So there are connections in the film and I sort of have to trust the viewer to make their own, and sometimes they pick up on what I intend and sometimes they see things that I didn’t see. Early on there’s a scene with a representative––so someone in state government. But the film does quickly go into all of these other spaces that are the institutions of our society and those are political spaces. So it goes to schools, it goes into hospitals, it talks about prisons. And so I think that in terms of, also this question of how do you represent democracy, it’s also again not just reinforcing these clichés that it’s electoral politics alone and something that you only do in capitol buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so I’m going to ask you a big maybe red arrow question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Okay, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I mean, do we live in a democracy in America today? You said earlier something like, “we’ve never actually lived in a democracy” and so maybe it’s just expanding on that but I think in America you’re raised to think America and democracy are synonymous, they go together, America has always been the birthplace of modern democracy in some way and this is where democracy will always thrive and they’re inseparable in some way. Even though I think much more rarely you actually ask what that means and what democracy is, and how that can be squared with the history of oppression and the many people who have not had any say in what happens in America for most of its history. But do we today live in a democracy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The answer to me is definitely no. But I also think that we live in a world that has been democratized in relation to what came before it. So this idea that democracy is a process and that it’s this ever-expanding concept. And I think when I went into this project I was much more skeptical of the term. For me, the Bush era was so formative. This idea that we’re bringing democracy to Iraq and that word was not a word that inspired me––words like equality and justice and socialism and revolution. And so I was actually quite surprised by how, through the making of this film and also writing the companion book that’s going to come out in the spring, how that actually made me go, no this word is actually really powerful and this concept is really powerful even if it’s never been actualized, it might never be actualized. So I think the answer is pretty straightforwardly no. It’s actually surprised me how many people with no irony say, you know that––a professor at Columbia University, who shall not be named, introduced the film last night and he said, oh you conceived this film when most of us thought we had a democracy. And I think it’s quite interesting that these people who thought we had democracy are now actually the ones who are so convinced that it’s all over and we’re about to have fascism. Like what a frail institution that was, if it can just be taken away so fast. I mean part of the problem was that their concept of democracy was pretty weak, it didn’t really involve them doing anything except going to vote. It didn’t demand anything of them. At one point, the Greek scholar just mentioned, Effie, she says democracy was in the original sense, was understood as our capacity to do things together, that it’s a collective action. There’s quite a difference. I mean I think there are some people who are really grieving. They really feel like we had democracy and now it’s gone and they’re really grieving that. And so for those people I hope the film is a little bit of a slap in the face and is like no, for a lot of people this society has never resembled something that could be described as democratic. Which is not to say there hasn’t been progress. But I’m just always surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It makes sense to me that you had this sort of trajectory through thinking about democracy, because I was struck by how seriously the film takes critiques of democracy, from thinking about Plato’s anxiety and fear that democracy always devolves into tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornel West from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
The fact that the founding text of the Western philosophical tradition, Plato’s “Republic,” provides the most powerful indictment of not just democratic practices but the possibility of democracy. He argued that every democratic experiment, every experiment in which those Sly Stone called “everyday people” attempt to govern themselves, will result in tyranny because there is too much unruly passion and pervasive ignorance among the demos, among everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I have to say, it is disturbing to reread Plato and see his description of how tyranny comes about from democracy and then watch the clip of Trump saying people who are going to rule, while he is styling himself as a strong man type person. But even beyond Plato and beyond Trump, there are many people in the film who say versions of democracy have always been an experiment at the expense of Black people, is what one woman says in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aja Monet from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Black people have been the experiment of democracy. We have been at the expense of this so-called democracy. So what, is democracy good for us? It’s never been good for us. There’s never been a democracy, to me, in my mind. So if that’s the case, it’s kind of like, fuck it. Why are we having this conversation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So Federici says women have never been protected by democracy. There are a lot of points at which it’s very clear that democracy has not been good for a lot of people and certainly many people have never been included in it. You know, you talked to people about the Voting Rights Act and voter suppression. Reverend William Barber is at some point talking about voter suppression and this attempt to roll back a very short period in which the voting rights of Black Americans were protected, like a very, very short period of time. And yet it ends––there’s a very strong current of the shortcomings and failures of democracy, but it feels like the argument of the film in some way is that what we need is more democracy or to achieve the democracy that we never have. Cornel West talks about Martin Luther King and Fannie Lou Hamer. These more radical democrats, more radical than the democracy that they were ostensibly living in and how they’re doing sort of democracy from underneath American democracy. And so I wonder how you see that, more democracy? How do we do more democracy? How do we achieve the democracy that we haven’t yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, it can actually be a kind of a liberal cliché, like, oh, the solution is just more democracy. That’s kind of what I was arguing against in my Internet book. I was just like, what do you mean, democracy? More democracy is just the free market, like no thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Or it’s the Silicon Valley version, which is just selling more people more stuff or giving people access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Or voice without power, so you can express yourself but you can’t really change things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Or you vote but nobody listens to your vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So I mean I think there’s a way the word is really up for grabs. I like what Silvia Federici says. She actually says democracy has never “befriended” women, and I think it’s this image of democracy some people want, where democracy just friends you, and it doesn’t demand anything of you. It’s not a pain. I think some of the dilemmas that the film raises about democracy are timeless. Even if we had our socialist utopia where there was collective ownership over wealth, we would still have to figure out the boundaries of decision-making bodies, who makes decisions for a specific factory? The workers, should the community have input, what about people who live really far away? I mean, these issues like how how much do we prioritize the people who live now versus the people who have yet to be born; how much needs to be planned versus how much needs to be spontaneous. Some of these problems, they’re not going to go away. Hopefully the conditions under which we’re asking them will get better and we’ll have better problems. But I think we’re always going to have democratic problems. And that’s why I think these questions are worth elevating and grappling with, because they I think they will stay with us. And as an activist and as someone who engages in economic justice organizing, and who is frustrated when social issue films that end with a really pat call to action or a Kumbaya moment of everybody out in the streets holding hands with rousing music. And so I wanted a film that was more honest, that I personally found credible. I’m not saying those films are dishonest, but they just irritate me. And so the film doesn’t end with an explicitly hopeful note. It ends actually with this image of Silvia and I still talking, like the conversation isn’t over. It was just important to me to not wrap it up with a bow and act like it’s figured out, or that if we could just have a big enough protest, we’d have democracy. Because that’s not true. In fact one of my guiding principles was that I wanted a film that began the day after the big protest that most movies end with. What do you do the day after, when you had your big mobilization but everybody’s gone home, but the problem is still there and the media has moved on and you still have to grapple with the issues? And that to me is more credible. And I think it’s why there’s always a portion of the audience that comes up and tells me that they feel hopeless after watching it, but then there are some people who really appreciate that it doesn’t pretend that things are easier than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, absolutely. You definitely don’t want to suggest it’s ending on some “woo” note because if anything, it feels quite troubling. Towards the end, you get into these really severe challenges that are facing democracy today, justice, equality––many of the things we might want to exist in more robust forms than they do today or these values that we hold in some way. So one of them I wanted to get into some was this… you’ve talked a bit about––you do economic activism and one of the themes running through the film is certainly the theme of the effects of concentrated economic power on the ability to realize democracy, the gap in wealth, whether in this Plato’s city, the city of the rich and the city of the poor, or very obviously in America today and in the world today, and there’s this one point in particular I wanted to ask you about, which I thought was really interesting, where you ask George Papandreou, who’s the former prime minister of Greece, you ask him who rules. Just a very classic question. And he answers “the market,” which I thought was so interesting because the usual political theory answers are the one or the few or the many rule, and the one rules when it’s a monarchy or a tyranny, and you can have the few rule when it’s an aristocracy or an oligarchy, and when the many rule, it’s democracy. And he says something totally different, he says the market. And it suggests that nobody is even in control, it’s a set of impersonal forces that of course are acting through people and that people are working to execute, but that seem out of control in some way. And this comes in the film in the context of the discussion of the Greek referendum on whether to accept the IMF and ECB bailout which came along with austerity measures, basically, and people voted no and then a week later the market was like, you’re gonna take our deal or you’re going to be in trouble. And so it’s this really interesting moment and I wonder how you think about this question of the market and capitalism and whether it’s compatible at all with democracy, when for a couple decades there was a story about liberal capitalist democracy, is that it all goes together and that’s how things work. And I think that is much more in question now. So how do you think about those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I really tried to shoehorn in this scene and the scene didn’t work otherwise, but it was a scene where someone just said capitalism and democracy don’t go together. In an economic crisis, the first thing they’ll get rid of is democracy. Again, it’s this moment of the explicit or the implicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silvia Federici from 
What is Democracy?:&lt;/strong&gt;
 In the 13th century, in Siena and surrounding areas, a banking system emerged. So what this town represents is really the beginning of a capitalist society. In 1287, there was a revolt in Siena that gave power to an oligarchy of merchants and bankers. This is the room where they used to meet. And then around 1330, they commissioned the painting of this room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And I think even without that scene, the film makes a pretty strong case that capitalism and democracy are on a collision course. I think there are all sorts of historical reasons why that marriage came to be and why there’s this messy divorce that seems to be happening. So the film, it definitely delves into the history of democracy at least in the sort of mythic form going back to Athens. But then the reason that I followed Silvia Federici in Siena in Italy is because Siena is one of the centers of banking. So how do you tell a parallel story along with a story of democracy? How do you tell the story of capitalism? And so I guess I could have gone to sort of the fields of the enclosure, but there may not have been much of the film there; we would have just walked around what is probably now a city. But basically there’s this amazing fresco painted around the time when the first banks were developed and it’s the first secular fresco and it’s called the Allegory of Good and Bad Government. And it’s this amazing painting that this group of oligarchs who ran this city-state painted for themselves so they would remind themselves not to get too greedy or let things get too out of hand. And so just as the film’s addressing sort of contemporary political problems, I’m also trying to say, okay the contemporary economic problems also have a long history. And the problem of oligarchy is something that goes way back. And I think the challenge was precisely what you said, which is like how do you represent the market? I mean I definitely didn’t want to individualize the bad guys too much. So I didn’t want to say the reason that we’re not living our best democratic life is because of the Koch Brothers or Trump or whatever nasty figure I can come up with. Because it’s not about those individuals, it is about the structure. But then you also don’t want to slip into having it seem like it’s some paranoid fantasy. “Invisible power.” But I needed that theme to be at the heart of the film. And I hope that nobody misses the message that right now, capitalism is the threat. I mean capitalism concentrates wealth and power and that is inimical to the idea of a system where political power is broadly shared. It doesn’t make any rational sense for those two to go together. But I also didn’t want to use tired, I didn’t want to use rhetoric. I wanted to make that argument in a way that felt novel to me. And so that’s why the scenes that are most about capitalism and exploitation are us looking at this painting from 1338. And part of why I did that was because I felt that it would get me and get Silvia out of our usual language and our usual rhetoric and to think on our feet––we analyzed this strange symbolic fresco––and to express ideas in a different way, instead of just going to the formulations that we’re most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I love the scenes with the fresco because I’ve seen reproductions of it and I have looked at it, have never thought about it that seriously. And watching the two of you talk about all of the different parts and how you could interpret them is really amazing. So I love those scenes. There are also some really great scenes of Greek pensioners fighting the riot cops, when they’re being cut––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, elderly people literally beating up the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. So there are certainly various depictions of democracy coming into conflict with capital. And this is one of the big questions and challenges that is still hanging at the end of the film, and you have a conversation with Wendy Brown where you’re talking about, how do you confront something like global capital? Is that something that’s possible to do through global democracy? She’s pretty skeptical. I’m curious what you think about the question of how, politically, to confront a system that is global and that exceeds the bounds of existing political communities––it has never had a political and certainly not a democratic community that is equal to it in scale and scope. And you and Wendy Brown get into this question around, what are the bounds of the democratic community? Do there have to be bounds? And Wendy Brown says I think there always have to be boundaries around the democratic community and doesn’t say what exactly those are, recognizes they’ve often been racial, gendered––and certainly that’s what we see in a lot of growing nationalist movements today. What can we do to confront global capital? And what are the communities that can take on that really monumental task, and how can we reimagine what those political communities are that aren’t just going back into the familiar form of the nation state and nationalism that comes with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think even if I had the right answer that question it would be a problem of doing it, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes. As with all of the great political questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yes. I mean, Yanis Varoufakis and Bernie Sanders have announced their new international front to combat the strangely contradictory, international nationalist, right-wing front that seems to be forming. It seems to be very well organized. And I think they probably have a great analysis. But the question is okay, but how do people do it? What structures connects this concept of a leftist International to where we actually live on the ground? And that’s always been what––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 We have internationalism as an ideal and something that has been very robust at times but is also different than a democratic community in the sense of a political community that has teeth or that has the ability to––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, to challenge power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I mean, that’s the thing. You can have solidarity in theory, which isn’t to say it’s not sincere, but it can actually be hard to embody and to challenge structures that are very distant. So that’s definitely a theme of the film too, the fact that power has moved further and further away from people. I mean I think to answer your question, I think in some ways we do know some of the answers. The answer is to to strengthen labor, to create associations where people can exercise the power that they have collectively. So the work I’m focused on is around indebtedness. So I co-founded a debtor’s union called the Debt Collective and we launched a student debt strike in 2015 that has won over $600 million for its members. And we’ve been battling with Betsy DeVos for the last two years as she tries to roll back some of the modest gains we made. But I think you know for me, thinking about, in addition to traditional workplace organizing, thinking about how we actually organize around finance, because these are chains that tie, that link us as individuals. The chains of debt tie us back into these big financial structures that are international. But I think we have to take stock of just how, when we say power has moved away from people, it’s not just that it’s moved to Washington. I mean there’s literally these supranational institutions that are purposefully opaque, that were designed without any public input, that supersede domestic law and are not subject to any sort of democratic control. So it’s a really tough challenge. The situation we’re in…we can kind of see these structures and how illegitimate they are and how they’re essentially almost a sort of shadow government led by corporations. But how do we actually combat them? And the film has a sort of global dimension and it talks about these meta-problems but that’s why the scenes, they always come back to Earth. They always come back to a place and to people, because democracy has to be enacted between human beings. And it’s funny because we always think, okay, democracy: the people who rule. So there’s sort of the “who” question and then there’s the “how” question. So who are the people, how do they rule. But then there’s also the where. And I feel like that doesn’t get asked enough in general because we do have to do it somewhere. And places is so central, which is place, whether it’s the workplace in the film, or the city––where’s the place of democracy? Because it does have to come from below. I really believe that, the more I’ve thought about this and after making this film, it has to be grounded in a place in a community. Again, to go back to this idea of Varoufakis and Sanders announcing an international, that’s great, but it has to have roots if it’s going to have power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 At the end of the day, somebody is talking to somebody else about what you’re going to do and I think at the end of the day all of politics kind of comes down to these conversations that people are having with one another and deciding what to do. And that’s what I think really comes through in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It comes back to your question, which is how do you represent democracy. It’s people doing stuff. Again, our capacity to do things together. We haven’t automated ourselves away yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Well, keep an eye on the democracy bot coming to a retailer near you in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Denvir:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Dig, a podcast from Jacobin Magazine. My name is Daniel Denvir and I’m broadcasting from Providence, Rhode Island. Typically, we think about migration as immigration: people crossing international borders from one nation state to another. And for the past half century in the United States, we have tended to think about that immigration in a binary way: legal immigration versus illegal immigration. But to understand the origins of the immigration politics in general and the criminalization of Mexican immigrants in particular, that have become the core of the Trump presidency and of conservatism as a whole, we must explode these categories, identify their origins, and analyze the history that preceded them. Nativist arguments are often made by reference to people’s own forbearers “coming the right way.” But for much of American history, “coming the right way” simply meant showing up as a white person from the colonial period through the early 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration was basically open for white people––white people who were needed to settle an expanding nation by holding dispossessed Native land and to labor in the industrial armies of an ascendant capitalist empire. Indeed, for much of that history the major dividing line wasn’t between native-born citizens and immigrants at all, but rather, between settlers and colonized populations––subjugated peoples who were either excluded and expelled, or subjugated as low-caste workers consigned to the hardest and most degraded labor and denied basic political rights. So to understand Trump and his “border crisis,” we need to rethink American history using different terms and categories than the ones that the mainstream immigration debate provides us with. We must look at the politics around international immigration as part of a broader set of policies and ideologies governing the movement of people based on where they were fixed by American capitalism’s racialized labor caste system and imperial designs. In other words, immigration can’t be understood apart from policies and ideologies that sought, amongst other things, to provisionally synthesize the contradictory realities of a racist and brutally exploitative political economic order that constantly required the presence of nonwhites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more to discuss, but I’ll save that for the interview, which is with Aziz Rana, an all-star returning Dig guest. Here’s Aziz Rana, a professor of law at Cornell Law School and the author of the bookThe Two Faces of American Freedom,
and the forthcoming bookRise of the Constitution
. His work focuses on how shifting notions of race, citizenship, and empire have shaped legal and political identity since the American founding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Aziz Rana, returning champion, welcome back to The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aziz Rana:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thanks for having me back. Really looking forward to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The place I think we need to start a discussion of American immigration politics is within a framework that you write a lot about, which is that of colonial settlement and settler colonialism. This country has, for most of its history, been a project of demographic engineering. We can look back from the moment of British colonization, through the first naturalization law passed shortly after the Revolution, through a system of slavery that made forced African migrants into unfree laborers, through the settlement of the West, which was methodically undertaken to ensure overwhelming white majorities, through Chinese and Asian exclusion stretching from the 1880s through the first half of the 20th century, and through 1965, when a law was finally passed that ended a system that since the twenties had nakedly restricted immigration from outside of northern and western Europe. And those are just some of the explicitly racist policies. So my question is, to frame this interview, if you could explain the ideological and political economic role of white settlement in the formation of the US as a country and how that should inform the way we think about immigration politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 As a way of getting into the question that you asked, I think it’d be really useful to lay out how most people tend to think about immigration politics and the way that it’s presented in the news or in regular conversation. The idea is that immigration is really just a question of the border. It’s like, people appear. They seem to appear magically at the border, and they want to have access to the country because of various kinds of economic needs, and then the country has to make decisions about whether or not to allow people in, including based on judgments about threat or safety. And then this issue about the border, which is something that is viewed as its own separate domain, that it just happens, it seems to happen out of thin air, is also distinguished from the question about what rights should be afforded to people that are non-citizens. And the thought there is that states are organized just, you know, seemingly naturally, on a distinction between citizens and non-citizen. Citizens are part of a democratic community, they get various kinds of protections and rights and those protections and rights are not appropriately provided to non-citizens. And that whole framing, I think, really misses the fundamental impulse behind American migration policy, really, from the very earliest days of North American colonization, so even before independence. Immigration is part of a much more complicated story of population control, and population management, and the ways in which both control and management were really meant to facilitate settlement out West, and the expansion of a very particular vision of national identity. And so it’s closely tied to domestic colonization, to the way that the US is located in global structures of empire, and also to the types of economic organization, typically the rise of modern industrial capitalism, that went hand in hand with these projects of settlement. And so if you just extract immigration policy from that and just read it as a story of the border that’s not bound to these much thicker, deeper relationships, then you’re essentially missing the stakes of the conversation today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I want to ask a theoretical question before we get into a lot of historical specifics, which is do we need to stop thinking about immigration politics narrowly as such and instead conceptualize of immigration as a legal and ideological subset of a population politics? I don’t know if that’s the right term, but something along those lines––governing race and place, that functions by creating castes and ideologies that legitimate and synthesize various capitalist modes of accumulation on the one hand, with particular nation state projects on the other? Do you think that this is the sort of framework we need to use, or would you put it another way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s really important to think of what we currently talk about as immigration, as really a story of the demographic management of populations. Who counts as an internal member, what rights are accorded to those that are insiders, and then what kind of treatments face to those that are viewed as “unfit” in various ways, either to remain, or that find themselves facing various kinds of subordinated status. This means that, in a sense, some of the best comparisons are––or continuities that we’d see in terms of thinking about what we today refer to as immigration policy––would be with the treatment of Native peoples in the 19th century, the treatment of enslaved African persons, the structure of policy towards Mexicans that didn’t migrate to the US but that found themselves now as part of the US state because of the outcomes of the Mexican-American War, and that these continuities tell us actually a lot more about the shape of US practices towards different kinds of different populations and movement, than just a simple focus on what’s happening at the border and what kinds of “protections” were needed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One last theoretical point before we move on to the history, it seems one key thing that we need to do to accomplish this more comprehensive framework within which immigration is a subset, or the way certain types of population politics appear to us because of their political expression, it seems like one thing we need to do is to move beyond methodological nationalism that takes the boundaries of the nation state as a given and thus treats international migration as this wholly distinct thing, both from domestic migration and, more generally, from the politics of race and class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. So that mythological nationalism is built on a particular kind of post-World War II order at the international level for thinking about the nation states, which is, the world is a product of formally equal states that enjoy various kinds of international guarantees and rights, and that provide a set of protections to their own citizens, and to the extent that their citizens are in other states, those are essentially people that are more or less out of place, and have differential kinds of relationships with the states that they’re visiting or trying to migrate to. The problem with that way of thinking about the world is sort of twofold. One is that it fundamentally obscures the way in which the formal equality of these nation states at the international level is belied by systematic forms of economic and political inequality. So, being a citizen in the United States means something that’s fundamentally different than being a citizen in Kenya, where my father’s family is from. And that has to do with the nature of the global economic and political order writ large, and in particular, it has to do with the long afterlife of the imperial order that preceded our present post-1945 structure, which is the extent to which histories of colonization and empire shape the terms of membership. And it also obscures the way in which the US isn’t just like any other state. The US isn’t even “the first nation among equals.” That, since 1945, it has been the dominant global power, that we live in an era that’s best defined as an era of Pax Americana. It might be retreating in various ways, but it shapes the terms of this larger economic order and it means that just thinking of each state as equal, and that citizens from one state somehow are inexplicably attempting to enter other states, basically ignores the reasons for circulation that shape this global order. And we can get into some of the specifics about American foreign policy in particular, but I think at a theoretical level, the point is to essentially explode the idea that these are all just equal states, and instead to recognize the extent to which what we have is an order that emerges out of the collapse of the old empires and that’s shaped by the dominant global position of the US and that imposes very clear structural inequalities that determine how movement operates and in particular, allows the free flow of capital from the Global North, and the US especially, into the Global South, and that inhibits or constrains the free flow of labor in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Okay. We’ve laid a pretty solid theoretical foundation, I think. Let’s turn back to some of the history, starting after the Revolution. The American project required westward conquest, which in turn, required both Native removal and new settlers, to ensure a European majority on the land. The flipside of that expansion conquest was that it provided an escape valve from eastern inequality, which gave whites the settler promise of free labor tied into this measure of internal equality. And I think it’s important to emphasize that white settlers weren’t just allowed in. They were recruited. And white immigrants in the 19th century were even widely allowed to vote before they had naturalized. They were in essence deemed Americans overnight because they were white settlers, which was, definitionally, what an American was. Can you explain how this division between settlers and colonized people, rather than one between Natives and immigrants, dominated the United States and what role it played in the country’s development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You know, this covers a bit of ground from stuff that we’ve discussed in previous conversations, so my apologies to listeners if this sounds a touch familiar. But the best way to think of the early American project, and really this is from the 17th century to the early 20th century, is as a sustained experiment in what I call settler empire. And this experiment was organized around a variety of fairly clear principles. So you had Anglo colonists that came to North America, and they carried with them a radicalized version of the republican tradition. In other words, they understood free political and economic relationships as built around having control over one’s productive life. So owning land, having a shop of one’s own, and having that tied to direct political participation. So freedom as self-rule is something that was thick. But they also saw the possibility of being able to have this kind of project as requiring a second feature, which is territorial expansion. There needed to be enough land that was broadly available to those that were insider settlers to be able to actually enjoy something like free self-rule. And then, that led to two other key elements. The third was that there was also an understanding that not all forms of work are free. Societies necessarily, and especially agricultural societies, require degraded or hard forms of labor that are not compatible with the position of economic independence. And the way that settlers solved this problem starting, really, in the mid-17th century, was through African slavery. So the idea is that you have communities that are forced or compelled to engage in the most subordinated forms of work, and then you justify that subordination precisely in racial, and to a lesser extent, religious terms as well. And then this led to a fourth point, which was really key to the project of American settlerism and territorial settlement, which was that, pretty soon, in the 17th century, English state policies start to shift. So initially, the crown is interested, actually, in sending people to the colonies, because they are worried about overpopulation, various kinds of economic and political threats. But by the time we get to the second half of the 17th century, England actually wants to have its own working class stay, to be able to build the industrial economy there. And so you have settlers in North America that have a significant demographic need, and the demographic need is that you need to be able to actually populate new territory that you’re taking over, in order for the project to be able to sustain itself. And so what emerges, and what you see, really, through the 19th century, is a surprisingly open policy to foreigners coming from abroad, but in particular, to foreigners that are deemed coethnics, sharing a similar cultural and ethical project and territorial expansion. And so initially this is Protestants. So you have French Huguenots or other kinds of Protestants, from especially Western Europe, but over time, it becomes a larger category of European or white. And we can talk a little bit about what that means. And then there are a series of policies that end up getting implemented to induce both migration from abroad and also westward settlement. So these are some that you’ve already mentioned: you have the provision of easy naturalization processes during the colonial period. You have the provision of noncitizen voting. So voting that’s pegged to residency during the colonial period. And these things end up carrying over after independence. So the first naturalization laws, 1802, say that for “free white men,” you can naturalize as a US citizen after five years, as long as three years before the naturalization you assert your intent to naturalize, and then you have a variety of different states and territories that use that as a basis for providing European noncitizens with voting rights, where they say that if you assert your intent to naturalize, whether or not you ever actually naturalize as a US citizen, that you can enjoy voting rights. And then that goes hand in hand with access to western land grants and essentially the conditions, both economic and political, of enjoying something like free republican citizenship. And it also has all sorts of kind of surprising elements that we might not initially think of. For example, some of the very first states and territories that provide voting rights for women are states and territories in the West in the late 19th century. And the reason is, if you’re committed to a project of demographic settlement, then you actually need to have families. And this becomes very much a politics of not just population control and management, but reproductive management. And so you’re providing voting rights to women to induce white women to move to western territories and land, to be able to facilitate a politics of settlement. And the thing that ties all of this together, for what amounts to a three century period, is what you noted in the beginning. We tend to think of politics as organized between a distinction between citizen and alien, or, during the monarchical period, between the subject of a monarchy and an alien. And instead, what defined the long array of American politics was a distinction between settler and non-settler. And this is really significant because if you take most of the monarchies on the continent during the same era, they had really restrictive inheritance rights, land ownership rights, for noncitizens, based on the thought that, well, wait a second, you don’t want noncitizens to be able to inherit or to own land in your own territory because that would be a foreign potentate, since they’re essentially the subject of a foreign king, having control within your own country. So it’s like a stalking Trojan Horse. But in the US, the thought is precisely the opposite, which is no, you actually want European migrants to come because they’re participating in what amounts to a racially defined project of settlement and control. And indeed, what’s way more important than citizenship status is whether or not the particular individual is ethically part of the project. And you can really see this play out in terms of the variety of treatment that’s instead subject to those that are viewed as on the outside, to the non-settlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Such as we see with Indian removal and the debates over slavery, show the way that people who are geographically inside are still very much treated as outsiders in terms of the dominant caste of the settler project. And––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
I was just going to say, and just a note about this. So by the time we get to, let’s say, the mid or late 19th century, we could be talking––you know, we’ll talk about, I think, the status of the Chinese in a bit––but if you just look at enslaved African Americans as well as non-slave African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native peoples, so these are all groups with long and very rich histories on the land. And yet, in distinct ways, they find themselves subject to what amounts to an extreme form of discretionary power that is a product of a kind of old, imperial, royal prerogative that is the form of essentially unlimited course of authority that those on the outside face and that applies in different ways. So you have enslaved persons that essentially are denied any meaningful rights, you have non-slave African Americans whose movement is very closely controlled. So if you’re a non-slave African American and you’re not a resident already, in a southern slave state you weren’t allowed entrance into the slave states. Non-slave African Americans weren’t allowed entrance into various western territories. So were explicitly excluded from the conditions of economic independence and incorporation through these land grants, that European migrants who had just arrived and had no connection to the land, immediately enjoy. And then you can say a similar thing about Mexicans after the Mexican-American War, where the Mexican-American War ends with a treaty that provides all Mexicans that are now on US territory with citizenship status. But the states, and California in particular, quickly move in to say that, well, unless you are white––if you are Mexican but not of white ancestry, then you don’t have voting rights. And Native peoples face their own distinct, but kind of parallel, structures of control, built around the reservation system, and then also systematic denials of voting rights and various other kinds of protections for those that are even formally included as citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And a quick interjection, Mexican Americans, even though they’re technically deemed white by the Treaty of Guadalupe, are subjected to Jim Crow-style segregation, brutal state terrorism in Texas, and, as you mentioned, land dispossession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. And the thing that’s really key is that the criteria of being a formal citizen is largely irrelevant to the rights that you actually end up enjoying. African Americans, at least at the state level, and we’ll spend some time talking about Dred Scott and what Dred Scott says about African American federal citizenship, but at the state level, African Americans that are not enslaved, formal citizens; Mexican Americans, formal citizens; Native peoples, oftentimes through congressional naturalization, formal citizens; and yet face systematic rights denials, because what’s actually more important is whether or not you’re seen as somebody that is a participant in the settler project. And that means that a European, in Europe, is in fact more of an American if they’re the kind of person that you want to induce to come and settle than a person that is a formal citizen here. And it also means that the way that these policies operate is through the inducement of bringing particular populations to the continent and then essentially balancing between two different kinds of impulses about non-settler groups that are really colonized subjects here. And one impulse is removal, and you see that through things like the Trail of Tears and Jackson’s policies, and another impulse is not removal but kind of sustained subordination, and subordination to provide something like a pliable labor supply. And you see that especially, for example, with enslaved African labor. But in both cases, managing who stays, who remains, and under what conditions, is the guiding framework that sort of constructs all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I want to make clear that this isn’t just a matter of a historical injustice in the 19th century that has passed. If we want to take seriously the idea that the politics of international immigration, on the one hand, and internal migration on the other, are interconnected parts of something bigger, and we want to look at how decisive the politics of Black migration have been, we can start with Black movement being controlled not only by slavery in the South but also fugitive slave acts and by multiple non-slave states barring the very entry of Black people entirely. And then, as you referred to, the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision denying Black citizenship, and then the threat of Black migration out of the South overwhelmingly shapes the debate over abolition, when colonization of slaves to Africa or elsewhere was widely held to be the only way that slavery could be ended. And then it doesn’t end there. The entirety of American history that follows through the present, arguably, in terms of the politics of the Black freedom struggle and of the Great Migration and the system of metropolitan segregation that was erected in response to the Great Migration and Black freedom struggle––these are the key events of American history up to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One way of thinking about the past, to the extent that people are willing to recognize this particular kind of settler history, is to essentially divide the past between an era that existed, and then there’s a break, and instead what we have emerge in the 20th century is something like civic nationalism built on free and equal principles that undergird the market and liberal democratic politics. And so it’s essentially a move from an episode that might have previously occurred, to a completely different political order. And I think the key point is that rather than there being a break between a settler past and the civic national present, that these two are really deeply interconnected and they fold into one another throughout this whole period from the 17th century to the present. The kind of impulses that shape the basic terms of the American settler project persist. They persist in novel ways, but they nonetheless have really significant effects for ongoing policy, notions of national identity, and the types of debates that we see at the present. So like one thing that I’ll say, just about the Black migration that you noted, that highlights these continuities. So Chris Muller is a great sociologist that does stuff on mass incarceration. He notes that along with metropolitan segregation, the movement of African Americans north is also, in the period from the 1920s to the 1940s, the time that, in northern prisons, you start seeing, really, the disproportionate imprisonment of African Americans. It’s one of the significant prehistories of the modern kind of mass incarceration story and it’s for comparable reasons, which is, you have a new Black population and a Black population that’s understood by white elites in particular communities as a threat to their notions of identity and membership. And incarceration becomes a tool of managing what amounts to the Black body. That’s a story that we would never think of as an “immigration story.” But if you explode the focus on the border and you think of this as, how is it that different populations in movement end up being controlled and what shapes those forms of movement, then you can see, in lots of interesting ways, what we think of as the story of mass incarceration or the New Jim Crow have direct connections to how a cohesive state project is conceiving of who counts and who doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Thinking about nativism more broadly as this threat posed by people outside of the dominant caste, and you write that what settlers viewed as a central danger was that the government would treat settler society insiders in the brutal and subjugating manner that was ostensibly reserved for outsiders, which goes some way towards explaining the Declaration of Independence’s condemnation of King George for having “excited domestic insurrections amongst us and endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The part of the Declaration that we tend not to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Though it’s published on the back of the New York Times every July 4th. And settlers, you write, contended that that Britain had relegated them to what they consistently described as a condition of slavery. What does it reveal that white Americans have so consistently looked to subordinated people as a metaphor through which to interpret their own fears of their own political-economic subjugation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The heart of 17th century settler ideology and legal frameworks was a division between again, settlers and non-settlers, and the thought is that for those that are included as settlers, the benefit is supposed to be this really rich account of freedom, of self-rule. And that means that the way that political life is meant to be organized is through an intricate system of checks and balances, like all of the stuff that we tend to talk about, for example, when we talk about constitutional liberty and protections. But the thought is that for those that are on the outside, that it is appropriate to exercise what I, in the book, call an imperial prerogative, because of its continuities with discretionary royal power, to shape both the differential terms of subjectship that those communities face, but also to just mete out various forms of violence and coercion, from removal to imprisonment, you name it. The worry that you see articulated during the revolutionary period that becomes a kind of continuous refrain of American politics is that it’s the English Empire that’s treating its rightful subjects, so Anglo colonists, as if they’re colonized, dependent subjects. As if they’re non-settlers. That they’re using that royal prerogative in ways that are inappropriate and ignoring the kinds of checks and limitations that are supposed to apply to insiders. And one of the ways that they’re doing this is––this is the reference to enslaved persons and to Native Americans in the Declaration of Independence––is by potentially challenging, in limited ways, whether or not you will have additional rights or protections to those that are enslaved, treating Native populations potentially as also English subjects, and so attempting to balance the interests between settlers and Native populations. I don’t want to suggest that the British Empire is behaving in ways that we should, like, applaud. So this is an empire that’s dealing with lots of different complicated population centers and is attempting to essentially maintain order through a project of balance, but that doesn’t mean that it’s in any way committed to the rights protection of subordinated groups. But that’s a worry that motivates the Revolution. And it’s a worry that persists in the US, and it persists in the US in a sense because there are essentially two ways that republican freedom can be made broadly accessible. One way is over time, as a country becomes more industrialized, by actually transforming the economic institutions of the place, ensuring that those economic institutions are actually being controlled by the bulk of the people on the ground. And another way is through the project of expansion west, which is a constant safety valve for the kinds of internal white class tensions that emerge. The American story is by and large the systematic failure to use energetic government power to control new forms of economic hierarchy that emerge, and because expansion west, and what you can think of as various forms of Native expropriation, a strong color line between whites and African Americans––all of these are the ways that end up sustaining what you can imagine as white, economic populism because these predominate. Then it becomes increasingly clear to more and more white citizens that if they find their own rights being infringed, what that actually looks like in practice is being treated like the types of communities that are meant to serve the state, rather than the states meant to actually aid or enhance. And those arguments just come up over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You can look at Southern massive resistance to integration, which displaces the reality of Southern white despotism over Southern Black people as some sort of federal tyranny; or tax revolts in the 1970s sparked by what were seen as transfers of wealth from the white middle class to subordinate groups; and opposition to school and housing integration, which was seen as this judicial imposition on the properties of white middle class people; Nixon’s Silent Majority; the Reagan Revolution; the Tea Party, quite explicitly a tax revolt. And now, with Trump’s maximalist, white national decline grievance politics––and nativism, I think, is always at the central of this ideology, because it posits the idea that the demos, the very underpinning of the democratic project itself, is being invaded. And you look at the rhetoric around Mexican criminality and demands for citizenship echoing the Declaration of Independence’s description of Native violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You know, what I’d say that’s sort of connected to this long story is that one of the things that happens pretty early on in the new republic is that energetic government action, government power, especially energetic government power from the federal government, is viewed as an assault on the kind of local prerogatives of communities on the ground. And it’s also viewed as the kind of thing that’s only supposed to be applied to those that are outsiders, and that a lot of how notions of freedom and self-rule end up playing out is through claims about policing having this imperial prerogative, that’s being asserted by the federal government, apply toward local groups. And so it could be everything from like, it’s that federal government’s prerogative that’s limiting settler slaveholding rights out in the territories that somebody like Taney is so upset about during Dred Scott. But you can see it play out continuously, and it slowly also then becomes a kind of justification both for, if the state is asserting this violent prerogative and it has to be confronted, and that whenever it’s being applied, it’s treating you, as a white insider, as if you’re an excluded outsider population, then the only real place of free choice is through market relations, and that to the extent that your freedom is tied to your market choices, that it has to constantly be pushing back against what’s seen as these impositions from the government. So it’s a kind of continuous theme, so that there’s been debates about the American state, about like, why is it that Americans have this anti-statist “impulse,” or why is that such a strong and powerful strain? And I don’t think it can be understood without recognizing how generations of Americans came to see who should be subject to various forms of coercive power, and then viewing particularly the federal government’s actions through the lens of who should be free from various kinds of imposition and who’s actually rightly subject to it. And so I think you’re absolutely right to see that as something that’s continuous all the way through the Tea Party and the contemporary debates, for example, about standoffs in Oregon and the Michigan militia, and on and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I want to shift gears and turn to opposition to Chinese migration in the late 19th century, which is really the inception of formal immigration politics. How did the closing of the western frontier, which was accomplished, of course, in significant part through Chinese labor on the transcontinental railroad, help facilitate the rise of Asian exclusion? And how was it that the Chinese were simultaneously viewed as an economic, cultural, geopolitical, and political threat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Starting with the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century, over the course of the second half of the 19th century, something in the neighborhood of 250,000 Chinese migrants come to the US. By the time we get to the 1880s, like 90% are in the ten westernmost states and territories, two-thirds are in California. Just like with many populations, Chinese migrants come for various reasons, oftentimes tied to economic opportunity, and there are clear inducements on the part of both private actors and state actors to bring these populations over in order to be able to complete some of the economic settlement projects. But what Chinese migrants face almost immediately is this essential backlash about whether or not you can properly include Chinese as free citizens. And you know, even before the closing of the frontier, the fairly systematic answer becomes no. And what you see emerging in the last 20, 30 years of the 19th century is a new federal deportation system. That’s really the first time we have federal deportations at all that apply exclusively to Chinese, and it’s part of a kind of steady or slow roll of policies. So the first thing that happens is that during Reconstruction, you have a move away from 1802’s naturalization policy that said that you can only naturalize free whites as citizens, and you have Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner that say, well, everybody, regardless of their own background, should be able to be naturalized as a US citizen. But instead, the naturalization policy focuses exclusively on previously-enslaved African persons. And the reason why is because you already have a kind of groundswell of opposition to including those that are Chinese, and then, more broadly, Asian migrants find themselves in a category “aliens ineligible to naturalize.” So they’re non-citizens that can never become formal citizens. And then you have the very first federal deportation laws, something called The Page Act. The Page Act is meant to limit entrance and then to be able to remove people that are associated with criminality and prostitution, but really what it ends up targeting are Chinese women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And to pause you really quickly there, why is it that this heavily gendered framework is the first effort at immigration restriction––formal immigration restriction, period, and Chinese exclusion in particular? Was it aiming to keep the Chinese community from reproducing itself by ensuring that it remained overwhelmingly male?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. So between 1875 and by the time we get to like 1890, so in a period of 15 to 20 years, the Chinese population goes from one where there’s a substantial or sizable female population to 27:1 male. And the whole point is to make it impossible for Chinese people to be able to sustain a way of life in the US, to be able to reproduce, to establish families, develop communities, to become fully part, in a sense, of the land and territory. And you can see this as a really interesting inverse to what’s happening at the same time, that I mentioned earlier, which is, all of these various policies that are trying to induce or convince white women settlers to move from the East to the very same territories, including through providing white women voting rights, but there’s a number of different inducements. And the whole thought is that you’re trying to construct a white family and that through control of hearth and home, you can actually both demographically purify the area, but also have the kind of ethically and ethnically appropriate community to engage in settlement politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And that’s a reminder that immigration politics in particular and race and place politics more generally are always reproductive politics. And there are just innumerable examples of this, from violently anti-miscegenation ideology being the cornerstone of both slavery and Jim Crow, as economic and social institutions, to today, the long-running nativist alarm over Latina fertility and so-called anchor babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, I mean, you can see things like the Page Act as the prehistory of the obsession with anchor babies. It’s about, you know, how is it that you demographically purify the republic, and the extent to which you’re using ethnic markers as judgments about who can appropriately enjoy the benefits of free citizenship. And you know I’d say that this is not an American story alone. The use of these kinds of reproductive policies as a way of shaping demography we see globally too. And then so first, you have aliens ineligible to naturalize, so this is the experience of Chinese immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And that’s 1870.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, so that’s 1870, where the naturalization laws are not written to be universal. Then 1875, you have the Page Act. And then you have the Chinese exclusion laws in 1882 and then 1892. And what these do is they bar, entirely, Chinese labor. And then on top of it, what you end up having are alien land laws. These were laws that were passed at the state level. That if you were an alien ineligible to naturalize, so basically this is targeting Chinese––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And then Japanese––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. Chinese and Japanese. That you could not own land. And this is a form, just like the treatment of non-slave African Americans and other communities that we’ve discussed in the antebellum period, of essentially disinvesting, disinheriting a population from access to the conditions of economic and political independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Which is this ideologically self-serving circular logic, by saying Chinese and Japanese people are not capable of free citizenship, and free citizenship requires economic independence, and we are denying you the basis of that economic independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. I mean, this is the same story that you see repeated over and over again, that you saw with with enslaved African persons. That you need certain populations to engage in degraded or hard forms of work. And that’s, I think, the continuity between enslaved African Americans and Chinese, that we’re engaging in essential work for the construction of the American West. But, you know, then the statement that the reason why we’ve consigned you to this hard work is precisely because you’re unfit for free forms of labor. And then the story with what happens with the Chinese population are, in a sense, a kind of uneasy truce between two different kinds of countervailing pressures. One is, you know, a long-standing labor nativism that we can get to. So the California Workingmen’s Party is a strong backer of Chinese exclusion. So the desire to forcibly remove these populations because they’re understood as a threat to white labor. And then, you know, a business community that wants an industrial reserve army that can both depress white wages, but that can also be used pliably to serve various kinds of corporate interests and territorial expansion out West, but wants to ensure that these populations do not have rights that are meaningful. And so you have this steady balance of a population that’s present, but that’s limited, but that’s essentially denied all the conditions of free citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Something that you have mentioned a few times in recent minutes of this interview is how Reconstruction era politics surrounding Asian exclusion and modest Black incorporation intersected. You mentioned the 1870 legislation which extended the right to naturalize to Black people but denied it to Asians. And then there is Justice Harlan’s famous lonely dissent in the Supreme Court’s 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which legalized so-called separate but equal treatment of Black Americans. And Harlan makes a point of favorably comparing Black Americans to disparage Chinese and I’m just going to quote a brief passage from it. “There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But, by the statute in question, a Chinaman can ride in the same passenger coach with white citizens of the United States, while citizens of the Black race in Louisiana, many of whom, perhaps, risk their lives for the preservation of the Union, who are entitled, by law, to participate in the political control of the state and nation, who are not excluded, by law or by reason of their race, from public stations of any kind, and who have all the legal rights that belong to white citizens are yet declared to be criminals, liable to imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by citizens of the white race.” What does this differential way that two different subordinate groups were treated during this period reveal about how different strands of late 19th century settlerism managed a system of incorporation and exclusion that was changing so much in the wake of slavery’s destruction and also amidst the closing of the frontier and the rise of industrial capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 It’s a remarkable passage and every year when I teach Plessy vs. Ferguson in constitutional law and students read that Harlan dissent, they’re really thrown by those passages, because the way that the dissent is generally treated in our public conversations is, you know, Harlan is the lone voice of Reconstruction here, where he is essentially saying that, well, wait a second, what is it that the Civil War was supposed to be about? The Civil War was not just about ending formal slavery, but it was ending what he, in many opinions, called all of the badges of servitude. And that included a systematic structure of racial subordination, and he views the emergence of a new system of Jim Crow as a continuation of these badges of servitude. So he has this very stirring language about the Constitution’s colorblindness and the importance of thinking of African Americans as full citizens. What he’s highlighting here is a really interesting thing, which is, throughout much of American life, whiteness has a kind of property value; there’s a property interest and a set of benefits that come from being white. He’s saying, well, the whole thing about the Civil War is that Blackness has a kind of property value too, that African Americans fought and died on the side of the Union, and for that reason, to have whites and Blacks separated in these coach cars is a disservice to the point of the Civil War; indeed, to have a situation where you have the children and ex-Confederates lording it over a population that fought for the country, as opposed to behaved treasonously, is like, unacceptable. But––and this is the big “but”––he’s navigating the late 19th century to say that African Americans should be settlers, too. That’s the heart of his argument. But if African-Americans should be settlers too, that doesn’t mean that everybody’s included. There are still communities that are culturally unfit for full membership, and the community that he has in mind, the Chinese. And he’s using the juxtaposition as a kind of rhetorical point for a white audience. The white audience sees Chinese immigrants as so culturally distinct, so dissimilar, not sharing any of the religious or ethnic background in free citizenship. And yet they don’t necessarily face, according to this law, though they did according to a variety of other laws, systems of segregation. Like, how is it acceptable to treat African Americans worse than we’re treating Chinese? And it speaks to something you asked earlier, which is that for an overlapping set of constituencies, there was the view of the Chinese as an unassimilated danger. So that they were a danger––and this ends up including Japanese as well––they’re a danger to some members of the white labor community because of the economic challenge and really the competition over wage-earning jobs, especially as the frontier closes and industrialization becomes more and more intense, they’re viewed as a geostrategic threat because of the sense that China is this powerful empire, that it’s emerging and rising in the Pacific and especially at a time in which you have growing non-white political assertiveness, and that the US is a white outpost in the non-white world, and so the challenge of a non-white empire is particularly pronounced. There are cultural threats because of the thought that they’re not grounded in the same kinds of Christian traditions that even Catholics are that provide a spiritual formation for free citizenship. And that all of these things together mean that you cannot include Chinese as equals. And the best way to understand what’s going on here, and how this plays out, is actually by comparing this case, Plessy vs. Ferguson and Harlan’s opinion, to another case that––usually the two aren’t linked. And that’s a case called Wong Kim Ark, from 1898. And Wong Kim Ark is a case about a Chinese person that is born in the US and so enjoys, under the 14th Amendment, birthright citizenship, and that is returning back to the States and is denied entrance at the border based on the thought that, well, actually, this person isn’t a US citizen––a claim that the person is in fact not a US citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Because their parents were not citizens. And Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, because the parents were not citizens. And this ends up litigating the question about whether or not children of non-citizens in the US enjoy birthright citizenship status. And the majority of the court says yes. And the thing that’s really interesting about that case is that the court’s majority is the same as the Plessy majority, and Harlan is in dissent in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 He signs on to an opinion by another judge, named Fuller, which basically says, you cannot provide Chinese people with birthright citizenship precisely because of their cultural unfitness. And that, to him, citizenship means something, it has these substantive values, it brings with it a rich array of rights. The “him” here is Harlan. And so giving all of those rights to the children of Chinese immigrants is to essentially fundamentally compromise the racial composition of the country, and so the ethical composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And tellingly, the majority opinion in this rare case that affirms any sorts of rights for Chinese Americans also believes that the basic framework of white citizenship would be challenged by not extending 14th Amendment protections to the children of Chinese citizens. They write, “to hold that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children born in the United States of citizens or subjects of other countries would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.” So there’s the shared logic in the majority opinion and the dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, absolutely. So that the majority thinks it’s essential to extend birthright citizenship to Chinese because to reject the principle of birthright citizenship would undermine, as you stated, the citizenship status of a vast array of European migrants. And the majority is still absolutely committed to the project of ensuring settlement by these communities. But then there’s a second thing, and this is in a way what the disagreement between the majority and the dissent ends up turning on, which is the majority is not concerned about providing birthright citizenship to Chinese because there’s no presumption that you have to provide extensive rights to people that are citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So consistent with what we’ve been describing is like, the central divide is between settler and non-settler rather than citizen and noncitizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah, these same people voted for Plessy, so they’re like, well, we could just have a caste system that subjugates them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. Their view is like, well, they can be formal citizens, but then the only people that have voting rights would be white. Those that enjoy birthright citizenship that are of European ethnic backgrounds. And so they’re perfectly comfortable with the idea, well, the solution to this is establishing a Jim Crow system for people of Chinese and Asian descent. Which is, in fact, what ends up happening out West. And in a way, the reason why this is an interesting moment is because, in a sense, both Harlan and Gray––those who write the majority opinion in all of these, in Wong Kim Ark, and even Brown, who writes the majority opinion in Plessy––all of these are folks that are still committed in a deep sense to the infrastructure of settler politics, but are disagreeing about how to navigate which populations fit where and whether or not the solution is essentially removal or subordination for the populations that don’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And turning to the dissent, Fuller and Harlan argued that the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” clause of the 14th Amendment couldn’t apply to the children of Chinese non-citizens born in the United States because Chinese people are bound to the Emperor “by every conception of duty and by every principle of their religion, of which filial piety is the first and greatest commandment.” Which meant they were “subject to a foreign power.” That’s revealing in a lot of ways. One is that it reveals how basically and fundamentally immigration politics are always thoroughly geopolitical. The dissenters here, like many opponents of Chinese migration, very much do see Chinese migrants as agents of the Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. So, just to do this as a gloss, if this was the end of the 18th century, that argument would be applied to which community? That would be applied to Catholics, and in particular, French Catholics. And this is the view of Quebec, for example. That Catholicism is a religion that requires your obedience to a pope. That means that you’re not actually capable of being a free citizen. End of the 19th, early 20th century, these arguments applying to Chinese and then they’re going to apply with increasing intensity to Japanese citizens and migrants as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And the anti-Catholic iteration of that emerged in the mid-19th century, right before the Civil War as well, with the Know Nothings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. So there are clearly these different moments. The end story of the treatment of Chinese and Japanese is the 1924 National Origins Act that essentially bans entirely migration from Asia. And then you have the Japanese internment that takes place in World War II, and then I’d say you have a similar set of arguments that get made about Muslim populations, Arab and Muslim populations, today. That there’s something inherent about Islam, like Islam is a religion of authoritarianism, it promotes various kinds of violent sympathies that mean that Muslim populations are on a kind of path to radicalization that makes them unable to participate fully as Americans. And indeed, the forms of things that we see as markers of good American citizenship––dissent, political participation––these are threatening when they come from Muslim communities and have to be criminalized through statutes like material support statutes. And this is why I focused on the ends of these centuries. Like what is it about the late 18th century, the first half of the 20th, the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century, with Chinese and Japanese citizens, and then Muslim populations today? These are all places, geopolitically, where American power is hot. In other words, these are central sites of conflict. And the thing that’s ultimately, in a way, making these communities especially dangerous at these specific moments in time have actually nothing to do with the internal characteristics of the community. Why is it that by the time we get to the mid and late 19th century there is, actually, despite Know Nothing efforts, a pretty steady incorporation of Catholics? You need those populations for the demographic settlement of the West and the geostrategic alignments shift. You can say the same thing about Chinese and Japanese migrants today, which is like, today, the story is that these are “model minorities,” with all of the attendant problems of that framing. But that’s because the site of American power has shifted in various ways. And then what is it about Muslim populations? Again, it has nothing to do with inherent characteristics of these populations; it has to do with, well, it’s the Middle East, and parts of Asia, that are precisely where American geostrategic power is most explicitly present as the effective regional hegemon. And you know, I think this is one of the things that’s pretty consistently missed, which is the story of the “assimilation” of any of these communities is never about, well, the community changed. They became Americanized. It’s always about, actually, the power asserted by the state shifted its gaze or focus in ways that made the population far less threatening in the terms that marked it in a specific moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. That’s so important. There’s this consistent threat. You look at Samuel Huntington’s work on Mexican immigration and this idea that there’s something uniquely unassimilable about Mexican migrants to the United States, the idea that they’re forming a nation within the nation, which is such a common trope on the nativist right in recent decades. But it’s an entire projection of the lack of willingness to integrate and incorporate from the dominant classes in the state, that the dominant classes wield power through, projected onto the subordinate group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 There’s another, even weirder level to this, that is commonly believed on the right today, that Mexican migrants are engaged in what is described as a reconquista or reconquest of, at least, the American Southwest. And to me, this seems like a really revealing conspiracy theory, because it is Americans at the center of empire projecting their fear of imperial dominance onto the victims, the subordinate groups, within US empire. I don’t know if this is going too far, but you think it’s fair to say that one of anti-immigrant politics’ central functions is precisely to obscure American empire by fetishizing the immigrant symptoms of that empire?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The thing that’s noteworthy about the story, about the relationship between the US and Mexico that we’ve already highlighted is, first, to the extent that there is a conquest, half of Mexican territory is taken from Mexico. And you have a population of individuals that become US citizens but are systematically denied the basic benefits of, in fact, being a citizen. And then what you end up having in the 20th century is the extensive effort, that’s a unified effort of both state and business, to attempt to essentially use migrant Mexican labor as a way of providing a new pliable labor supply that’s engaged in work under degraded conditions with limited rights. And you have this through various kinds of official programs like the bracero program, that operates in the mid-century that brought annually 200,000 people to work in the US, but then you also have lots of other formal and informal networks that actually make the border something much more of a fluid site of movement, where you have communities that exist and family networks that exist on both sides, dependent on where work is, and what the particular employment or labor pattern consists in. And that throughout this whole mid-20th century period, what ends up happening is that during periods of economic downturn, or white nativist backlash, because of concerns about ethnic or economic threat, that you have the state essentially come in and engage in incredibly violent acts of population control. So during the New Deal, you have hundreds of thousands of Mexicans, including former US citizens that are forced to go back across the border to the US, families broken and destroyed, people killed. You have operations that proceed in the context of the bracero program in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and most famously, “Operation Wetback,” that forcibly removes, again, massive numbers of Mexicans across the border. All of this as the basic story of the first two-thirds of the 20th century is not a story of “Mexican reconquest,” it’s a story of Mexican labor that’s being facilitated through state and private actors to make the border something that’s fluid and then to face extreme forms of violence and subordination when it’s American business in the American state that views that labor as surplus or unnecessary. And then this, of course, in many ways actually becomes even more significant post-‘65, where in 1965, the US ends up finally eliminating racially restrictive immigration quotas. But what it does for the very first time is it then imposes a quota system on the Western Hemisphere. And it means that your movement from Mexico north now becomes subject to a quota structure, where the traditional networks of economy and family that had marked the symbiotic relationship across both sides of the border now end up targeting individuals, who are just doing what they’ve always done, as “illegal.” It’s at this moment, in a way, where you see the explosion of undocumented status for those that are Mexican migrants. None of this has to do with a story of geopolitical threat from Mexico or Central America. I mean, what’s motivating these shifts are shifts in domestic policy that are driven by domestic judgments and that are also located in a set of global relationships in which the US is asserting various forms of not just economic control, but real foreign policy violence on Central and Latin America, as you described with what’s happening in places like El Salvador by the time we get to the 70s and 80s. And so it obscures the history in a way that is super destructive. Telling the story as a story of like, it’s “Americans,” and really, this is coded as white Americans that are under threat from Latinos, not only very aggressively ignores the actual history, but it’s a form of continuous alibi which, in many ways, is a form of continuous alibi for the actual exercise of American global power and violence. And it’s an alibi that’s predicated, as we started the conversation, on this deep or rigid methodological nationalism. Oh, these are just the borders, and the borders protect those around the inside, and these folks, makes no sense why they want to come in, they want to come in because they’re threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And the people either cross it legally or illegally. Which, at this point, becomes the central distinction because, ironically, the 1965 law signed by LBJ, the Hart-Celler Act, prohibits formal racism in immigration law, but then leads to this incredible obfuscation of that deeply racist system at work. And so you have people speaking in this facially race-neutral language about their problem with undocumented immigrants isn’t that they’re Mexican or with immigration, it’s that they “came the wrong way.” Whereas their ancestors came the right way, which of course obscures the fact that for most of American history, the right way was just being white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And it’s also that for most of American history that the border is essentially a port of entry. And so there was no federal migration system in the same way, and that to the extent that it existed, it existed precisely to import you in because you are white. The other thing that I’d say about this, which is, so Hart-Celler and the 1965 bill, there are these three distinct periods, in a way, that have these overlapping effects. There’s a story of migration policy up to the 1920s. Really, what ends up happening in the teens is that you have the passage of literacy tests for migrants that are coming in 1917, and then two quota laws: the 1921 quota law that’s more racially inclusive and then 1924, which bans entry entirely from Asia and Africa. And that transforms the immigrant population from one that was more mixed in terms of European ancestry to 84% from Western Europe. And it also ends up dramatically decreasing the population of people that are foreign born in the US. By the time I get to the mid-20th century, the foreign-born population is like five percent of the country, where it had been 15% at the turn of the century. And the big thing that’s happening that’s provoking the change between the late 19th century and the imposition of these policies in the 1920s is the closing of the frontier, the way in which there just isn’t the same need for European migrants in order to be able to settle the West, and the sense that, increasingly, migrants are being experienced on the ground as economic competitors rather than co-participants in a shared project of American expansion. That marks the 1920s. And then there’s another kind of decisive moment in the 1960s, and the 1965 law is really part of the post-World War II, Cold War liberal commitment to what you can think of as Cold War civil rights. So it’s part of a civil rights project. The laws pass the same year the Voting Rights Act, the year after the Civil Rights Act; it’s strongly defended by folks like Martin Luther King and it’s understood as an assertion of a particular kind of liberal creed, that the US has stood, from the founding, for the principles of freedom and equality for all, the parts of the Declaration of Independence that we like, not the parts that we don’t like, and, in a way, that kind of ideological ground for the bill––like the bill is built on the idea that the country is a nation of immigrants. Everyone, you know, whether an enslaved African-American person or a person of Chinese descent, or somebody that’s Mexican or European, they’re all equally people that came from abroad and have built the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Which is incredibly novel in the 1960s. And Donna Garbaccia has done great research on this. It was only at the beginning of the era of restriction, in the late 19th and early 20th century, that the word immigrant even came into use, and it had a negative connotation at the time. Prior, people were called emigrants, which could refer to either people moving to settle out West, or coming into the country. It was more of a synonym for settler. But then suddenly in the 1960s, after JFK and what-not, there’s this idea that we’re, and amidst the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Freedom Movement, there’s this idea that we’re a nation of immigrants and to this day, liberals especially, I think, reread all of the country’s history backwards through that erroneous lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You know, it’s very interesting that we’ve been somewhat anachronistic in talking about the early history, in occasionally up and slipping in the word “immigrant”. The word that was used was emigrant. And it could mean coming from abroad, but an emigrant could just be somebody that’s moving from a different locality, from another county or another state. Oftentimes the people that were actually on ships coming from Europe, the term for them was “passenger.” And the way that migration policy was organized wasn’t even one that really emphasized a distinction between the national border and other local borders. You know, oftentimes it would be done at the state level and the state policy would be about limitations on people with contagious diseases, or concerns about folks that might be “poppers,” or removal of people that were poppers from one state to another, or placing people that are poor in workhouses, in places like Massachusetts or in New York. And immigration becomes the language of the new restrictionism in the late 19th century. And then it only really emerges as a positive language when you’re starting to get to the 1930s and the popular front culture of the New Deal that’s built on white, ethnic, working-class votes in the cities. That’s telling a story of cultural pluralism as what defines a country. Of course, the thing that’s really interesting about it is, it’s precisely at this historical moment where the borders you know most aggressively close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Including to Jews fleeing the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Exactly. And then it comes back––in the late 50s and early 60s, John F. Kennedy is very closely associated with the termination of immigrants, and it becomes the basis for the 1965 bill. And the reason why telling this is actually useful for the conversation we’re having about nativism is because the Hart-Celler Bill, the arguments around the US as a nation of immigrants, what it does is it obscures the nature of not just the history of population control but how the US is situated in the world. You know, the US, just a country like any other country, it’s relationship to Mexico is really no different than its relationship to any other country globally. There are no real power differences, to the extent that the US has any place in the world, maybe it’s like that first nation among equals. And so it’s totally appropriate. You know, you get rid of racial restrictions, you apply quotas to the Western Hemisphere, you apply quotas to the––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You get country-specific quotas in the 1970s applied evenly, which we still have today. That gives people from Bhutan the same number of visas as Mexicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And the only way that this makes any kind of sense is essentially if you’ve stripped all of the historical specificity and truth from the story of migration, which is, the policy has been built around demographic settlement of the right kinds of populations. The US is both a colonial enterprise domestically, and a particular kind of global imperial project, that then also has very complicated relationships with places like Mexico and other countries in Latin America, and that all of these end up shaping very particular population flows. There’s a population flow from Mexico that is not the equivalent of a population flow, as you said, from Bhutan. And the story of the nation of immigrants just means okay, the US is, it’s almost like it’s an island country, and everybody else sees this project of freedom and equality that exists domestically and just, you’re kind of jumping to come in, and so we have to put quotas to limit who can come in, but they come in from all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So we’re gonna have to be fair and give everyone––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You gotta be fair. And then the problem becomes, more people seem to be coming in than the quotas allow, and then the debate becomes, you know, the liberal positions: well, we should be more inviting about the people that want to come in and the “conservative” position is well, wait a second, laws are laws, and it’s illegal to try to come in in ways that supersede the quota. And so the nativists are able to essentially obscure the racial grounding of their argument, which is an argument about race, about, essentially, demographic purity, which occasionally seeps through. Occasionally you have Sessions––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Say something like, you know, I actually like those 1924 national origins quotas, or Bannon say we should be a “civic society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Or Pat Buchanan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 But for the most part, that all gets obscured, because in a way, it’s all framed through a popular conversation about the US as sort of ethically open to all but organized through particular rules that are colorblind and that highlight the country’s status as a nation of immigrants. And then what ends up practically is that communities that, in fact, because of colonial and imperial histories, have thick relationships with the country, find themselves facing the brunt, of course, of violence, in a way in which it’s very difficult, within the terms of American discourse, to even articulate why an undocumented migrant from Mexico is actually a subordinated person in this country––that’s tied to like three centuries of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. You write “now in place of European co-ethnics, immigrants to the United States are overwhelmingly nonwhite, the very individuals that settlers once deemed ‘unfit’ for full membership. And instead of extending settler projects into the frontier or ‘periphery,’ as 19th century immigrants did, today’s new arrivals in essence represent the movement of this periphery into the very center of metropolitan power.” I think this is very right on and as we’ve been discussing, it seems that this entire historical trajectory is obscured precisely by the nation of immigrant stories that pro-immigration liberals and establishment conservatives are so dedicated to telling. By contrast, the people on the most radical fringes of the nativist right are correct that immigration today is fundamentally different, but only the most brazenly white nationalist and paleoconservative nativists will say precisely why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 I think that’s right, which is there’s a particular kind of national myth that obscures the kinds of forces and dynamics that shape population movement. And the only folks that unfortunately seem to be willing to actually highlight the story of racially defined population control are the Sessions and the Bannons of the world that want to affirm a particular kind of demographic project. But I think the thing that, for those of us on the left, what needs to be said is that this operates in a couple different ways. So why is it that you have large numbers of people from the Global South that make up the predominant percentage of people that come to the US? And that’s a story that’s not just about like, oh, you know, folks from everywhere around the world want to come to the country because it’s free and equal. It’s a story about the profound global inequities that are hard-written into the international order, and of which the US enjoys the greatest amount of benefit. The US is a dominant global empire that has constructed international legal arrangements so that its capital essentially flows everywhere, while controlling the terms under which people come to the country, and those terms are, essentially, folks that can come to do hard work domestically but face a continuous shadow of probation and potential removal. Of course it’s going to be people that are from parts of the world that are historically colonized and dispossessed that are willing to move in the first place, but then connected to that general geostrategic point, there’s a point that you’ve made about foreign policy. Well, it’s also oftentimes people that are facing actual violence within their own home countries due to direct American foreign policy interference. I mean this is the story of Syria, of various places in the Middle East; this is the story, obviously, of Central America, Guatemala, El Salvador, etc. And then there’s a third point, which is the American project has been tied to particular kinds of both symbiotic but unequal relationships with particular states, like Mexico, and so obviously you’re going to have migration flows that are quite distinct from what you’d see in other parts of the world. And all of those actually have to be confronted and it’s why, in a sense, the solution can only begin by saying we need to repudiate this focus on the border as some kind of closed barrier that has to be protected for internal democracy, where the whole internal project is one about imperial expansion that has these reverberating effects. That’s why those from the periphery come to the center. And there needs to be recognition that those from the periphery that now are coming to the center are engaged in the same kind of hard work that was historically provided by subordinated populations under conditions that have really clear resonances in terms of limited rights protections, like the constant shadow of state and private violence––in many ways, the continuation of one clear side of the long story of demographic control in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The Wong Kim Ark ruling, which we were talking about a little while ago and led us down the path we’ve been on––I wanted to talk a little bit more about that because what it did was affirm that the 14th Amendment did provide birthright citizenship to anyone born in the US, regardless of the nationality or citizenship status of their parents. And this is incredibly important today because Trump has declared that he can end birthright citizenship by executive order without violating Wong Kim Ark on the grounds, if I have it right, that contrary to all normal interpretation of that decision since it was made, that the decision only granted citizenship in the case in question because the parents were legal residents. What does this reinterpretation of Wong Kim Ark at the moment we find ourselves in today say about the politics of reinventing caste in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 So the thing that I’d say is that we’ve spent a lot of time talking about––I mean scholars and activists over the last decade plus about the New Jim Crow as a way of describing the rise of mass incarceration and the kind of interconnections between race and class that mark Black subordination in the present. And I think that’s been a really powerful and important conversation. But I actually think there are really significant ways in which the contemporary treatment of undocumented populations, but really of large chunks of the immigrant community more generally, actually have very powerful echoes of Jim Crow. And that it’s another site where we’re seeing the replication of something that looks like a New Jim Crow. Maybe it’s just worth teasing out a whole bunch of it and showing how it’s connected to the birthright citizenship question. So, you know, liberal lawyers and scholars have focused on the fact that Trump’s argument about the children of undocumented immigrants not having birthright citizenship basically just fails as a matter of understanding the 14th Amendment, contemporaneous naturalization laws, the doctrine of Wong Kim Ark, and just very quickly make that argument and sort of dispatch it. So the point is that the 14th Amendment includes this language that says everybody’s entitled to birthright citizenship that’s subject to the jurisdiction thereof. And by all accounts, what the framers of the 14th Amendment understood that language to exclude were basically the children of foreign diplomats and foreign officials, based on the thought that if you were a foreign diplomat or foreign minister in a country, you enjoyed benefits of immunity, like you could be immune from local laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And just as the actual property of the embassy is technically foreign territory, your child, if they’re born here, is technically foreign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. So that you have various kinds of consular protections. And so all of that means that birthright citizenship should not then be extended to your children because of the fact that you’re potentially not subject to local law. That’s essentially what that caveat was meant for. There then becomes a debate about to what extent that actually also ends up including Native peoples––Indians “not taxed.” So these are Native peoples that are not living within US states and territories but remaining on Indian reservations, particularly during the era of the treaty system, where Native communities and Indian nations, essentially their policies with the US state was sort of organized through treaty practices. That’s the basic view that ends up undergirding the legal extension of birthright citizenship in Wong Kim Mark, to a Chinese person whose parents are non-citizens. It’s the basis of how the statutes have been interpreted and it means that this distinction between legal and and illegal resident just doesn’t hold a lot of water because of the fact that even if you’re an undocumented immigrant, you’re still subject to the laws thereof, like you don’t actually have various kinds of immunity, like protections from some foreign government. And then, of course, as a matter of historical argument it also doesn’t work, because the category of “illegal” did not even exist in the late 19th century. So all of these are reasons why these are bad legal arguments. But that’s actually not, I think, what’s at stake here. What’s at stake here is cutting against what was supposed to be the central purpose of birthright citizenship. So why is Section 1 of the 14th Amendment––why does it include birthright citizenship language in the first place? It’s meant to overrule Dred Scott. So Dred Scott is the decision in 1857 where Roger Taney says that African Americans, whether free or enslaved, have no rights that whites are bound to respect and that African Americans in either category are not federal citizens for purposes of the Constitution. And it does something else, which is it also says that if African Americans are not federal citizens, as a constitutional matter, Congress cannot naturalize African Americans, even non-slave African Americans, to be federal citizens. In other words, Congress can’t pass a law like the Naturalization Act of 1802, saying that that African Americans are now naturalized as federal citizens. And the reason why, according to Dred Scott, is because Taney says that the naturalization power that Congress has only applies to individuals that are foreign subjects of a foreign government that are moving to the US. And that enslaved persons and the children of enslaved persons are not moving from another country. They’re, you know, here on the land in the US. And so Congress doesn’t have these naturalization powers. The 14th Amendment’s birthright citizenship clause was meant to overcome that, and say no, that African Americans can be federal citizens. But more than just that, what it was supposed to do was, by establishing federal citizenship for African Americans, ensure––this is the goal of the Radical Republicans, at least––ensure that you have an end to a broader system of racial subordination, because of the thought at the time that there were these other provisions that actually gave substantive teeth to what it meant to be a federal citizen. Being a federal citizen wouldn’t just be an empty formal category with a variety of different stratified statuses and various forms of segregation, subordination, that go hand-in-hand with it. There are supposed to be privileges and immunities that attach to being a federal citizen; there’s supposed to be equal protection that attaches to being a federal citizen, etc. And the story of the last third, really, of the 19th century is that even if the South was no longer formally a slave economy, it was still in fact organized on principles of coerced and enslaved labor, and there wasn’t the political will in the North to fundamentally reconstruct racial and economic relations. And it meant that the old Southern slavocracy, and what became the new kind of white supremacist oligarchy just improvised, time and again, new ways of saying, okay, well, you might have birthright citizenship, but in point of fact, you’re going to be subject still to the same kinds of coercive labor and political regimes. And this ends up being sanctioned by the Supreme Court. So you have a case called The Slaughter-House Cases in 1873, where the court basically says, you know what, we’re going to essentially gut the meaning of the privileges and immunities clause. And so that there are actually very few rights that are associated with being a federal citizen. Most of your rights, like your right to vote, are state guarantees. And the court is only going to be in the business of protecting African Americans when states infringe on this very limited set of federal citizenship guarantees, things like being able to come to the seat of government, or have protections at the high seas, but not stuff like voting in particular. And you end up having the emergence of sharecropping, which sort of improvises new, bonded forms of Black labor. You have systematic voting disenfranchisement. And then you have a broader structure of segregation. And these end up being overlapping modes of white supremacy that maintain a coerced and dependent Black labor supply for white southern economy, while denying to African Americans any of the political rights that would be necessary in order to be able to contest that condition of dependence. And that’s the story of the return of white supremacy in the South, and it’s also the story of the gutting of the meaning of birthright citizenship. I would say that when folks like Trump invoke this rhetoric about how the children of undocumented immigrants should not have birthright citizenship, you should see it as a contemporary effort to essentially replicate many of those old systems and to, again, gut what’s supposed to be the meaning of birthright citizenship, which is like, no subordinated racial caste. Because look at what the present consists in. You have a population of undocumented immigrants––the numbers, depending on how they get counted, some numbers are more like 11 million, others say that the numbers are closer to like 20 million. The majority are from Mexico because of the kind of symbiotic relationships that I just described. They exist within a modern immigration system that’s a product of 1996 reforms, that Clinton signed into law, that essentially use a system of deportation, detention, and criminalization to mean that everyone, including legal residents, are on a condition of permanent probation that could find their status revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And as a quick aside, are deeply embedded in the War on Crime and also in the prehistory of the War on Terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Absolutely. 1996 is also the year that you have things like the passage of EDPA, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which is a way of essentially creating a new criminal system. That’s supposed to be about antiterrorism, but it again, provides greater criminal sanctions and capacities for the state to confront particular kinds of non-white populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 And then also the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of the same year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah. So that’s the immigration reform bill that I was describing from 1996. That’s like the key piece of legislation, and what it does is it means that you now have this population. The population is here because of various forms of state and private business inducement, as well as longstanding colonial and imperial patterns and symbiotic relationships that exist between different states, but facing the permanent threat of deportation because of these various reforms, like limited access to social programs and benefits, no voting rights, limited labor rights. And then the other thing that’s just sort the cherry on the top, so to speak––to just highlight the resonances with the late 19th century––that over half of the noncitizen prison population in federal prisons are in segregated prisons. This is incredible work that’s been done by a scholar named Emma Kaufman, and she has an article on this that’s forthcoming, I think, in the Harvard Law Review, but I could be mistaken about the location. Nineteen thousand federal prisoners that are noncitizens are in noncitizen-only prisons and the majority of them are there for low-level drug offenses––so not even for immigration related offenses. This is something that basically started emerging in the late 90s, as a kind of outgrowth of those reforms in 1996 and, not surprisingly, just like with past separate but equal systems, these prisons that, again, house more than half of noncitizens that are in federal prison, have limited health benefits, fewer various programs, higher incidences of violence, tend to be in more isolated locations further away from the families of people that are noncitizens. And if you take a look at this whole structure as a whole, what is it that you see? You see a population from the global periphery, precisely the parts of the world that were historically understood as unfit for full membership, engage domestically in the harder, degraded forms of work that are necessary for the economy but are not viewed as consistent with free labor, from difficult forms of wage-earning agricultural work to domestic household work that exists in the home that’s also highly gendered and feminized, living under circumstances where there’s a continuous shadow of state violence, with no meaningful labor protections, minimal access to social benefits, and on top of it, no meaningful political rights, including the right to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The state violence, the state repression, is integral to producing the category of illegality. You just mentioned the separate prison system––very much interior raids and also this spectacular militarization of the border, which arguably doesn’t do very much to actually keep people from coming in, historically, but does very effectively communicate to the American public this distinction that these people are illegal, through the criminalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Yeah and the other thing that you can say––you know, all of these analogies aren’t perfect fits. But the thing that this analogy is highlighting is that a large part of what old Jim Crow was about was an “economic system,” like maintaining a dependent labor supply through racial subordination and state-backed violence, including through spectacular acts of violence and lawlessness on the edges, like lynching and other forms of violence as well. And what it is that we see at present here is a system that’s organized to maintain a dependent labor supply and that operates through systematic disenfranchisement, and that uses spectacular forms of violence as well, including the kinds of state criminality that we’re seeing meted out at the border, like the separation of families, the death of migrant children, and on and on and on. So that means that when Trump talks about rescinding birthright citizenship, you know, maybe birthright citizenship is not going to get rescinded. Maybe it’s just rhetoric. But it shouldn’t be experienced as just hot air for a nativist base. It actually tells us something really foundational about the contemporary nature of migration policy and the way in which our contemporary migration policy essentially reasserts the very worst elements of how population control was managed in the “long 19th century,” and what in fact then might be necessary to overcome it. And that what’s necessary to overcome it is a heck of a lot more than some tradeoff between additional border security and limited domestic amnesty, let’s say, for Dreamers. That if essentially what we see are modern iterations of an old Jim Crow, organized for the old imperial prerogative, then this has to be smashed, root and branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 One other historical connection, before we close by talking about how we smash it, root and branch, is that just as the early period of restriction that accompanied the closing of the frontier from the late 19th to early 20th century, also restricted was an end to noncitizen voting, which had been so prevalent in the 19th century. Today, the Trump administration is trying to finish off that project or further consolidate it, or take it to the next level or whatever by ensuring that the census separately counts noncitizens, which has gotten a lot of play because it could depress undocumented participation in the census. But it could also potentially be used to do something that conservatives have wanted to do for a long time, which is to shift congressional and state legislative seats away from left-leaning areas with large immigrant populations by excluding noncitizens from the count that’s used for reapportionment. And this is remarkable given that the antebellum conservatives successfully counted their slaves as three-fifths of a person for purposes of their own political power, and also that conservative districts today, especially in rural areas, continue to count disenfranchised prisoners from cities as part of their local population for reapportionment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 This is why I think the heart of an agenda that’s actually a general liberation agenda but that’s also about what immigrant freedom means in the present has to be tied to resident voting. In other words, voting rights for noncitizens. And the reason why is because voting isn’t just about the issue of one’s participation in the political process and being able to exercise your voice about issues that are important to you, which is central to democratic theory. But it’s also fundamentally tied to the kind of power that various groups enjoy in society. And the United States, just like any society, is organized through fundamental contradictions between haves and have-nots: those that enjoy racial, economic, and gender dominance, and those that find themselves subject to various forms of subordination. And the vote is one of the central tools of being able to alter those power disparities. And it’s why voting throughout American history has been so central to truly radical insurgent democratic agendas. You know, it’s hard to imagine right now, but like one of the things that like you know Marx and Engels most wanted in Europe in the 19th century was universal suffrage. We don’t think of it as a radical thought, but the thought was, it’s not just that the vote means that you can participate in a decision, it’s that the vote alters the terms of who has power in the society. And it’s precisely why the long story of white settler ideology has been about systematically attempting to restrict voting rights from those that are viewed as outsiders, and to provide those that are seen as co-ethnic participants in the same project of settlement. And you know, it was central to Jim Crow to engage in systematic disenfranchisement and then to stay one step ahead of efforts to limit those forms of disenfranchisement. And it’s central today to the maintenance of various types of racial and economic hierarchy to dilute and limit the power of the vote, and to do so including through diluting and limiting the power of immigrant voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Your argument is that we once had the settler model that imposed internal equality which was premised on external subjugation and exclusion, but that the collapse of that model, if I have it right, has left us with the imperial prerogative being applied both externally and internally, which is the worst of all worlds. And what I’ll close by asking you what the alternative is, and when crafting that alternative, what we can learn from the history of efforts to universalize American freedom, from Radical Republicans to the Populists to the labor movement, and the limits that those efforts confronted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR:&lt;/strong&gt;
 You know, my vision of emancipation is probably not all that––I mean it’s not all that unique. So I think the goal has to be something like equal and effective freedom for all, and what that means is that everybody has control over the most important decisions that affect their lives, so decisions especially about the nature of their own work, experiences, and about the political society that they’re part of. You know, I see the way that we get there, as through, what sometimes folks called a prefigurative politics, or non-reformist reforms, or revolutionary reforms––pressing for a set of social changes that make it increasingly difficult, if achieved, like small-scale, intermediate social changes that make it increasingly difficult, if achieved, for the existing social order to reproduce itself. In the late 19th century it was things like the eight hour day or universal suffrage. Today, I think we can think of a variety of these kinds of reforms. Everything from a guaranteed job, to prison abolition, to what I was just describing with resident voting. And I think the two things that we can take from the past––one is the centrality of immigrant communities to the revitalization of emancipatory and liberation politics in the US, going all the way back to the Germans that came over after the revolutions in 1848. Those Germans had a central role in abolitionist politics. They formed elements of the Union Army’s officer corps that were really committed to uncompensated abolition and, in various ways, to socialist transformation until the late 19th century. And the role that new European immigrants played in revitalizing the labor movement and highlighting the continuity between American practices and feudal practices on the continent all the way to the present. And the centrality of folks from Mexico and Central America, and Latino immigrants in showing the linkages between capitalism and empire. And that strikes me as a key point of contact, which is the importance of taking the lead from new immigrant activist bases, understanding their own politics as one that shows that immigration is a place that dissolves the distinction between domestic and foreign, that these distinctions make no sense, and that unless you address networks of capital and empire that operate globally that you can’t actually alter conditions domestically, and then the second thing is avoiding the trap, basically, of some of the old elements of the labor movement and of progressive reform. And there’s a persistent tendency to essentially take a symptom, which is the general weakness of the status of workers––of various white and Black, white and Mexican––and then use that as a way of saying, well, look, the problem is the Mexican worker that’s coming across the border, rather than, well no, actually the problem is the structure of capitalism that provides the business elite to profit from the competition between poor workers under a condition in which American power allows capital to move while it places these various kinds of coercive restrictions on labor. And so the heart of this has to be responding to Trump’s emphasis on a racialized politics of demonization that blames the poor worker, essentially by saying, no, actually Trump is an embodiment of an oligarchic system that structures opportunities for both American and non-American workers in ways that are fundamentally unfree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Typically, people think about migration as&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;people crossing international borders from one nation-state to another. And for the past half century in the United States, people have tended to think about that immigration in a binary way: legal immigration versus illegal immigration. But to understand the origins of the immigration politics in general and the criminalization of Mexican immigrants in particular that have become the core of the Trump presidency, we must explode these categories, identify their origins, and analyze the history that preceded them. Dan interviews Aziz Rana.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family Values: Between Neoliberalism and the New Social Conservatism,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family Values: Between Neoliberalism and the New Social ConservatismCurrencies: New Thinking for Financial Times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Melinda Cooper, welcome to The Dig. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melinda Cooper:Thank you for inviting me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Before we get into the specifics of the history you’re telling, I’d like you to lay out your overarching argument that social conservatives and neoliberals both turned against the Great Society for different reasons but complementary ends. What comprises these various groups that you’re talking about in the book? What did each find to be so important about a certain sort of family, and what political-economic change did they seek and effectuate as a result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:So the neoconservative movement was born out of its critique of the Great Society welfare state. So they didn’t exist prior to the mid-1970s. And what was interesting about them is that they didn’t have a critique of the welfare state, per say. Most of them remained in favor of some form of welfare state and they had no fiscal critique of the welfare state. So they didn’t have that obsession about exorbitant public spending that you find among the neoliberals. They were very much attached to the New Deal welfare state and many of them came out of the left, even the Trotskyist Left. But they were concerned that the Great Society, perhaps unintentionally, had ended up subsidizing forms of welfare that were contributing to a breakdown of the family and that the programs around particularly the increase in funding to higher education, and the anti-poverty programs, the legal support programs, they were funding wholesale assaults against the New Deal familial order––so forms of anti-patriotism and student rebellion and critiques of the family. Their critique of welfare was a critique of Great Society welfare––the Great Society welfare state in particular. And you can say that of a lot of the religious conservatives as well. Surprisingly, a lot of the religious conservatives were not averse to the welfare state. They were averse to the forms of welfare that break down in conditionalities that you get around the mid-1960s. So the neoliberals were coming from a very different position. Their critique was primarily a fiscal one. And that critique was all about what they saw as an extension of demands, an inflation of demands, on this state that they thought were intolerable within the terms of the post-war Keynesian order, more or less. So they had kind of begrudgingly accepted the New Deal welfare state, to an extent that I think is not often appreciated. But the Great Society welfare state was one step too far for them, because they thought that its extension of benefits to all kinds of constituencies, to minorities who had hitherto been excluded, and especially the legal assaults on welfare conditionalities meant that this would just become an intolerable burden on the state. So their critique was primarily fiscal but was kind of connected to the moral critique, in as much as they thought that the extension of welfare to non-normative family forms, particularly female-headed households, was intolerable within the limits of the New Deal welfare state. It just couldn’t be continued. And at that, it completely upset the terms of the consensus between labor and capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:To set up your argument theoretically, you write that people on the left “tend to dismiss the florid defense of family values as so much flotsam and jetsam floating above the real story of monumental wealth redistribution and class warfare.” But your argument is that this isn’t a matter of structure in relation to superstructure, but rather, I guess it is sort of structure all the way down. And the upshot of that is that these commonly made distinctions between the politics of recognition versus the politics of redistribution obscure the fact that particular forms of identity politics have always been at the core of any given political economic order. Explain what leftists miss when they narrowly analyze power at the so-called point of product and what sort of theoretical framework you’re putting forward as an alternative to that approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Well, first of all I wouldn’t call sexual and racial politics identity politics. I think identity politics is a way of organizing any kind of politics, so class politics, race politics, or gender politics. I think that race and gender and sexuality, the forms in which wage differentials are organized––the most intimate level, and they’re the level at which they’re least open to critique, in which most people are, in some way, invested. When you look at the work of the American neoliberals, they’re screaming family politics––from every page, actually. I mean they’re not hiding the fact that they are completely disturbed by what they see as an expansion of the welfare rolls beyond the family wage. No, they’re not. Someone like Becker is almost only writing about the family. So it’s interesting to me that it’s often from the left––from the academic and critical left––that you find this erasure. Having said that, like most liberal economists, this is a part of the economic apparatus that they are remarkably un-self-reflexive about, so that they’re unable to see that a lot of what they have to say about the family is logically contradictory with their own kind of rational choice premises. And I think in a sense, this is a kind of an aporia that you encounter. Let’s say it’s not exclusive to economic liberalism. Yes, it’s superstructure all the way down and structure all the way up, but we also need to theorize why there’s this constant forgetting of the gendered and racial dimensions of political economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Does the right to a better job thinking about the intrinsic familiality and sociality of political economy than the left? It seems to me that the right has so masterfully pursued this reactionary agenda targeting the social, economic, and political totality, but that various sides of the liberal and left identity politics debate see things in the very siloed ways that they appear contingently under capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:So I was going to include social conservatives in my list of people who do this kind of division of labor, who are un-self-reflexive about the gender and race politics, but they aren’t, actually. Social conservatives, in particular, spell it all out. Why this is important, why this is the foundation of their social order, why you can’t move some kind of intimate detail of the family without threatening social order. So they do spell it out. You know, sometimes I suspect that the left, or parts of the left, are less honest about that, because there are affinities that are too deeply ingrained to be––so that there’s a certain investment in certain kind of gender divisions of labor. That kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to turn to some of the specifics of your historical argument. You write that the history of the family has always meant a history of the family in crisis, but that this crisis appears in distinct and even contradictory ways to particular people at particular moments. And so before we get to the era dominated by neoliberalism and social conservatism, we should address the basic contours of the period which preceded it: the post-World War II socioeconomic order, which, in short, was built around something called the Fordist family wage that––I’m quoting your book––”not only functioned as a mechanism for the normalization of gender and sexual relationships, but also stood at the heart of the mid-century organization of labor, race, and class, defining African American men by their exclusion from the male breadwinner wage and African American women by their relegation to agricultural and domestic labor in the service of white households.” Explain what the Fordist family wage was, how it emerged, and how it functioned to regulate seemingly every hierarchical relationship that characterized what’s often perceived on right and left alike to be a golden era of American life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Right. So the Fordist family wage was a version of the male breadwinner wage ideology, which has a much longer history. It goes back to the 19th century labor movement. The basic idea is that the male worker should be able to earn a so-called living wage, which is a wage that is high enough to provide for his own needs, but also for the needs of his wife and children. What was distinct about the Fordist family wage was that it was a form of male breadwinner wage that also extended to social insurance. So the social wage. The idea was not only that the wage would be sufficient, but also that the male unionized worker would benefit from all kinds of social insurance rights that his wife would then enjoy under a kind of social insurance cover charge, because she was dependent on unionized male workers. She also had rights and her children also had rights to all these forms of social welfare. So that was the idea of the Fordist family wage. In certain countries, like in Britain, the hierarchical set-up and the fact of married women’s dependence is very overt. So in the Beveridge Report that appeared in 1942, William Henry Beveridge refers to women’s vital but unpaid labor in the service of the nation, and that unpaid labor was all about reproducing the white British race.  And you get, similarly, very explicit statements about what this involves in the work of Progressive Era social theorists in the States. But the way that the New Deal welfare state actually implemented these kinds of hierarchies seemed to fall into place by default, and, in fact, the organizing categories are all around what looked like mutual distinctions between full-time unionized workers and, say, agricultural workers or domestic workers. And it turns out that these kind of neutral-sounding distinctions actually divide the population along the lines of white, male, unionized workers who generally have rights to a more dignified, less intrusive form of federal social insurance, and then single, unattached women, or women who are considered to be non-contributors, they don’t work full time, they tend to fall back into state forms of public assistance which are much more degraded and degrading forms of welfare. And then you have agricultural and domestic workers in the South who happen to be African American who will be almost entirely excluded from public assistance. So you have all these kinds of hierarchies of race and gender that are put in place by the Fordist family wage structure that don’t look like they’re put in place by intent, but which are actually unrelenting in their division of the population. And these are what sustain both the hierarchy of wages that endures after World War II, and the hierarchy of social insurance rights, so that you have a whole class of the population that is still living under this degraded public assistance system that is very much entrenched in the old poor law tradition. So in a sense, the poor law family responsibility tradition lives on for certain segments of the population; very much so for those who are minorities and also for many single women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:As you mentioned earlier, near the end of this period, before the neoliberal-social conservative convergence really consolidates, there was actually this remarkable consensus behind universalizing the family wage’s coverage so as to incorporate those who had been excluded from the core of the new order that you were just describing. For Daniel Patrick Moynihan, this was the solution to what he infamously described as the “tangled pathologies of the matriarchal black family under welfare.” Even Richard Nixon supported a basic income scheme and perhaps what’s most surprising, you argue that radical activists and theorists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven held out the universalization of the Fordist family wage as the end goal of their militant welfare rights strategy and, in somewhat unsettling terms, you quote from their famousarticle laying out their strategy. You quote from them describing welfare as reinforcing “the female as breadwinner in an already-female dominated household. Men for whom there are no jobs will nevertheless mate like other men, but they are not so likely to marry. Our society has preferred to deal with the resulting female-headed families not by putting men to work, but by placing the unwed mothers and dependent children on public welfare, substituting check-writing machines for male wage earners. By this means, we have robbed men of manhood, women of husbands, and children of fathers. To create a stable monogamous family, we need to provide men, especially Negro men, with the opportunity to be men, and that involves enabling them to perform occupationally. Over the long term, women will then leave the welfare rolls, not to work, but to marry.” It’s a remarkable quote and I’m surprised that’s the first time that I had noted it in the past. Explain the origins of this remarkable consensus around expanding New Deal social insurance on the terms of the normative Fordist family and why it collapsed when it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:So this was the last gap of the family wage ideal, and I think it was the last attempt to salvage it––the last point where you see what looks, in retrospect, like a completely unfathomable consensus. You have people like Tobin, you have Piven and Cloward, you have Friedman and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Nixon. You just can’t imagine these people together, all agreeing that the family wage needs to be extended to Black men also. On terms that are not wonderful, but this is as good as it gets. And very soon after the riot retreats, even on this. And the way I interpret this moment is that it’s a reaction to the welfare rights movement, and what my book brings to the fore, really just following the incredible historical literature on that movement, is that it was the welfare rights movement in particular, and it was this one not very expensive program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which had everyone bothered. And so this movement in favor of the universal income or negative income tax, which was Friedman’s kind of blueprint for it, was an attempt to salvage that consensus that had brought Democrats and Republicans together after World War II in favor of the family wage. And to say, okay, we can deal with the civil rights movement, we can deal with these new demands for social justice, for racial justice, that we’re seeing, but we want to deal with it by restoring the family form in some way. We don’t want to deal with it by conceding to the demands of the welfare rights movement, which, almost universally, on left and right, is seen as a dangerous threat to the family form––that this was really about subsidizing a form of non-normative living that should not be subsidized at all. So in a sense that there was both a concession, and a last gasp of the family wage consensus was to say, okay, we will increase benefits, we will make concessions to racial justice, but only if welfare is about buttressing the normative family form amongst African Americans. We will not consent to simply subsidizing Black single or unmarried women on welfare. So to me, it’s really amazing that Friedman was so centrally engaged in this, right up until the last minutes. So engaged that he actually provided the policy blueprint. Because very soon after this moment, the American neoliberals in general turned against the very idea of the New Deal welfare state. So there really is this complete 180 degree turn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And this rupture takes place around the inflation of the 1970s, you argue, which prompts both a conservative tax revolt and the very specific demonization of welfare as the icon of everything that has gone wrong with American political economy and society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:That’s right. Since I’ve written this book I’ve been looking a little at the literature of the tax revolt. I mean, the actual grassroots literature. And I was also surprised to see how obsessed these taxpayers were with Aid to Families with Dependent Children also, because a tax revolt was all about the property tax. And that did not fund AFDC at all. So there’s this fantasmatic contamination whereby this one little program that absorbs a minuscule amount of the federal welfare budget becomes this lightning rod, because it synthesizes fears about both racial and sexual degeneracy. And I argue that this program, however miniscule, was the lynchpin of the Fordist family wage because it was meant to exclude Black women. It was not meant to include African American women at all. And it was certainly not meant to include women who had never married. So the fact that from about the 1950s, African American women were entering the AFDC rolls as a result of migration to the North, and that many of them hadn’t married, was perceived as a complete betrayal of the New Deal spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Which is somewhat counterintuitive if you attempt to look at the economic interests of these white, middle class homeowners in a very narrow way. First, of course, they benefit from massive New Deal subsidies, which create the entire segregated metropolis of which they’re a part, which underpins the value of their homes, and then, inflation, contrary to conventional wisdom, is actually transferring wealth to those ordinary middle class homeowners in a lot of ways, because it is eroding the value of their debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:This is right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:But they turn against the poorest, most marginalized people in society and realign themselves politically with the wealthy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:That’s right. And that’s why it’s very difficult to see the neoliberal turn purely as a kind of imposition on the part of elites, because the real impetus, the real firepower, I think, for the Reagan Revolution came from the tax revolt. And that was a popular movement. So the first real victory of the neoliberal movement was a popular lower-middle class movement. And it took the form of direct democracy, so you couldn’t say that this was elite dupery. Having said that, there was a considerable misrecognition, as you say, about what social welfare actually means. And it seems to me that the more people subsidized by the state and the more guaranteed their subsidies are, the less often they’re capable of perceiving those. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:The more submerged the subsidies are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yeah, exactly, as the name of a book––I forget what it’s called. Oh, T. So there was a survey done just before the tax revolt, and I think was by Sears and Citrin and they were interested in the fact that––or Sears and Citrin were analyzing it. They’re interested in the question of what exactly people were opposed to. And so they asked them the general question, “Are you opposed to welfare?”. Yes, yes, of course. But when they broke it down, “Are you opposed to public spending on local services, like fire stations, schools?” No, no, we actually want more. And so every question they ask turns out this way. And so they dig down and finally they get to welfare and it’s yes, yes, we’re all opposed to welfare. But then you break down welfare into kind of various kinds of public assistance programs––Medicaid etc., all the components of welfare, and it all becomes much more ambiguous. No, no, we want more spending on that. The only nugget that remains is Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Everybody wants that to be slashed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:What do you know? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:It’s the property tax? But the property tax had nothing to do with Aid to Families with Dependent Children. But anyway, it was kind of a tax revolt. There’s an enormous own goal against the lower-middle class and the middle class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And that revolt is tellingly, also, amidst fights against taking place in California, amidst fights against school busing and school integration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:This is right, yeah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:The value of the home as both a social institution and as an asset is deeply, fundamentally contingent upon the segregation of housing and the resulting segregation of schooling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:There’s an idea that we don’t want our family capital to be lost through tax, to be siphoned through taxes, into a general fund that can then be redistributed willy-nilly, and that all kinds of borders, from the family, the garden fence, the municipality borders, will break down and we’ll have desegregation. So there’s this idea of wanting to contain funds back within the local area, within the family, amongst one’s kind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:In that sense, does whiteness––does race––serve as an extra sort of extended kinship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:I think so. Yeah, I think that’s very much in play in the tax revolt. I mean, obviously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:So in terms of the context of inflation, you quote some really wild stuff from neoliberals on this. The neoliberal critique really goes from the macroeconomic, which is what one might expect, to the almost spiritual. On the one hand, Milton Friedman believed that inflation financed welfare programs. But James Buchanan and Richard Wagner make this pretty radical argument that inflation shortened people’s time horizons, and thus led to a breakdown in public morality, including  “increasingly liberalized attitudes towards sexual activities, a declining vitality of the Puritan work ethic, deterioration in product quality, explosion of the welfare rolls, and more.” Explain the connections that neoliberals were drawing between monetary, fiscal, and moral laxity, and if you think, in a sort of twisted way, that they were correct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:In a twisted way, I do think they’re correct, but I’ll come back there. So this idea that inflation is symptomatic of moral laxity has a long history, and you find it in classical theories of sound finance. Inflation is the symptom of a breakdown in moral order because it’s seen as a fraudulent forced redistribution of wealth from the creditor to the debtor. So it seemed to be this terrible travesty of all kinds of proper hierarchical relations––the property relation itself. So you could fill pages of classical political economists and their screeds against inflation. I think what’s new about the critique that you get in the 1970s is, again, this conflation of the breakdown of household and familial order that is being subsidized by the welfare state, because, first of all, the expansion of the welfare rolls, but also, all kinds of legal challenges that you have to welfare conditionality at the time. So the welfare state is becoming much less of a normative beast, much less of the normative apparatus that it was supposed to be. And there is a logical connection there. I mean, it breaks down when you get into the detail, but the logical connection is that the normative family form was in some sense containing the social expenditures of the state, and that this was the condition of the Keynesian consensus. That, okay, you were going to have a certain degree of redistribution, but this would have to be contained in some way, and the normative family was the way it was contained. So the male breadwinner wage was the conduit for redistribution, but that also meant that women received less and only as dependents, and all kinds of people were excluded from this redistribution. So it’s true that the more that these constraints were questioned on legal terms and the more militant the welfare rights movement became, the more fiscal demands there were on the state. So there’s a connection, but the connection is not convincing when it comes to Aid to Families with Dependent Children in particular. It can become convincing with regards to social security, which Nixon expanded. He indexed to inflation, remarkably. And so these were the expenditures that were really skyrocketing in the 1970s. It was not AFDC, which was not indexed to inflation, so in fact its value fell in real terms. But somehow what was an almost-logical argument always returned obsessively to this one little program, which is really interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:What was happening more in the background, with the demonization of AFDC welfare in the foreground, was this political-economic transformation that took hold after the Volker Shock, which affected this huge shift from middle class people receiving more of their wealth through the social wage to a renewed dependence on family-based inheritance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Right. And I should be clear, AFDC was the first line of attack; public assistance was the first line of attack. But as soon as Reagan came into power, social security was attacked too. And of course, it was a much harder target. And they were unsuccessful at first, in that they have never completely privatized social security, but they have pushed a lot of people into these private savings accounts and, very explicitly, the logic there was that 401Ks, private savings accounts––these are inheritable assets. So you are returning to a form of private savings and a transmission of wealth. This is not social insurance. So I think, again, the subjective, the psychological work performed by the tax revolt was to detach middle-class homeowners from social insurance and to convince them that it was in their interest to reattach to inherited family wealth. I think all these moves had to be made to pursue a larger project, which was about trying to dismantle social insurance as far as possible. Of course, there’s something very utopian about it and it’s very difficult––they’re still going at it. It will perhaps never be entirely accomplished. Certainly, by demonizing AFDC, that enabled them to do a lot more. And I think why I find this survey I was talking about, about the tax revolt, so interesting is that it seems to suggest that a lot of people who voted in favor of these tax limitations, or who are in favor of federal balanced budget amendments, did not quite understand how dependent they also were on redistributive public spending.So they didn’t understand that they, too, would be in the line of fire. And in a sense, I see the Trump phenomenon as the legacy of that. It’s almost as if that misunderstanding is still there, and the scapegoating is still there. And there’s an incomprehension that this is something that the white tax revolt did to white people, in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Look at the Tea Party. That’s a white tax revolt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:It is. It’s a complete legacy of the tax revolt. It’s a tax revolt getting angrier and angrier at the punishment it’s inflicted on itself. You know what I mean? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:The apex of this reaction and this turn against welfare is to really instrumentalize it as a tool to morally discipline poor families. And that comes into legal existence by way of Bill Clinton signing congressional Republicans’ welfare reform bill, which is most infamous, of course, for curtailing welfare benefits, but it was also really centrally about promoting marriage and coercing mothers to locate the biological fathers of their children. And remarkably, the legislation’s more or less very first sentence is “marriage is the foundation of a successful society.” That’s like the first finding of the bill, which is wild. You write that welfare reform remade the Fordist era’s binding of Black women to white homes in the form of binding them to low-wage service work, to men, and to private religious organizations. And that, in turn, was part of this social conservative strategy to shift government funding towards supporting socially conservative mediating institutions––part of this process to defund the left and redirect taxpayer dollars towards these explicitly sectarian organizations, to institutionalize the religious right in a parastate role under the auspices of religious freedom. How was it that New Democrats, along with social conservatives, neoliberals, neoconservatives, all converged around a form of welfare reform that was initially pioneered as something radical by Ronald Reagan in California? What does that reveal about neoliberalism in its insurgent phase versus its moment of bipartisan consolidation? And finally, what does that tell us about how the liberal turn towards neoliberalism was inextricably and simultaneously social and economic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yes, so the Personal Responsibility Act was pure poor law. It was absolutely in the poor law tradition. But what is really remarkable is that this is being enacted at a federal level, whereas for the greater part of the 20th century, after the New Deal, it’s the federal government agencies that are at war with the states to try and undo the remnants of the poor law. So this is remarkable that a Democratic leader should federalize the poor law principle of family responsibility, and Reagan’s term as governor in California is really remarkable and interesting as a kind of laboratory. And he was seen as really extreme within the Republican Party. I mean, he was one of the most vocal critics of the basic guaranteed income idea; he even opposed Nixon and Friedman on that. So he was quite extreme. He was like a Barry Goldwater Republican. He performed some interesting experiments that were then carried to the federal level, but by Clinton. So what’s interesting about the United States, is all kinds of countries that have inherited the Elizabethan poor law tradition and the principle of family responsibility, but in the United States what’s really remarkable is that most states have family responsibility laws on their books. It’s like they’re there to be revived, and this is what Reagan tried to do, and he passed state-level welfare reform. He tried to reactivate these laws that meant that, perhaps, if you had a child who had to go into care for some reason, that the state could recoup money from relatives to compensate for the money it had spent. They were particularly active, of course, with imposing family responsibility laws on single mothers on welfare. So the laws in that case were about forcing single mothers to track down the alleged or supposed fathers biological fathers of their children. And they were required to do this. They were required to report if they were living with a man because they could no longer receive benefits, or the man would be compelled to provide for the children. So Reagan was very active and instrumental in the idea that this family responsibility tradition could really be revived. And so that worked more or less well. And Reagan had hoped to take this onto the federal stage but failed. He was not successful in completely transforming welfare on the federal level. And it remained for Clinton to complete Reagan’s experiment. What’s interesting about the poor law tradition, as I mentioned before, it’s a hybrid of liberal and conservative influences. So it’s always been informed by this fiscal concern––you have to recoup money that has been spent on the welfare poor by extorting it from their families. But it’s also been informed by various social conservative––especially religious––ideologies, that are all about reforming the poor: restoring their sense of morality and family responsibility, not just as a simple economic concern, but with a lived form of family normativity, if you like––a family way of life. It has these two strands and it’s not entirely surprising to me that the New Democrats––Clinton’s New Democrats––should be responsible for implementing this, because the New Democrats were neoliberals––Third Way neoliberals––but they were also communitarians. Communitarianism is essentially a social conservatism of the partisan left. It’s not very different from the social conservatism of the right. It’s a little bit more inclusive, if you like, and it’s a little less overtly religious. But the New Democratic ethos was a combination of neoliberalism and and communitarianism, and that could lend itself perfectly to the idea of restoring the poor law tradition, and I think that’s what was in play with Clinton’s Personal Responsibility Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Another thing that that elucidates is that neoliberalism is not, in this simplistic way, just a project of shrinking the state, but rather one that’s focused on remaking it to serve particular ends. I think you write that the “neo” in neoliberalism, in a sense, can be thought of as the fact that it’s liberalism that comes after and in response to the welfare state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yeah. And it’s often quite jarring that reforms that are introduced supposedly to save money, so the whole system for tracking down biological fathers cost so much money––and that money could easily just be diverted to a woman on welfare who desperately needs it and her children. But no, the disciplinary purpose takes priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:When there is all this money that’s expended… there was a great investigation not so long ago by the radio documentary program, Reveal–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Uh huh––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Looking at all of these these absurdly hucksterish marriage promotion programs that are funded by government. It’s wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yeah. I mean, not that the people who were in favor of marriage promotion ever had any problems with the economic extravagance of the welfare state; I should be clear here. So in a sense there’s concessions being made on both sides. The social conservatives never had any problem with welfare spending, as long as it’s pedagogical and punitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:So this is all part of this massive shift that you write about that has the consolidation of intergenerational transfers of wealth via inheritance on the one hand, and then on the other side of that is both welfare reform and this huge shift to private deficit spending, via both homes and student loans––all of which were supposed to be funded by rising asset prices. For New Democrats, it was even described, I believe––I’m not sure if this was their language directly––but asset-based welfare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:That’s right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Within which credit-fueled home equity, facilitated by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan’s model of low interest rates and slim budgets, replaced redistributive social insurance. And because we’re talking about homes, of course, it was also all about families, because homes are where families live. Bill Clinton said, “you want to reinforce family values in America? Encourage two-parent households, get people to stay home, make it easy for people to own their own homes and enjoy the rewards of family life and see their work rewarded.” There’s this whole democratization of credit that you’re writing about that, of course, can never be truly democratizing or redistributed because it was premised on the debt-fueled transfer of wealth upwards in an inheritance-based system that was itself built to fuel rising inequality. How was it that an accumulation strategy that used debt to reformalize relationships of subordination and independence and that ultimately, as we all know, laid the groundwork for the 2008 financial crisis––how did that get so successfully branded as a form of market-provided socioeconomic justice in the 1990s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Well, yeah, it’s interesting, because if you look at the statistics that we now have available––so if we look at Piketty statistical data––during the 1970s, equality reaches a high point in the United States. This is the catastrophic years of stagflation, and then inequality begins to rise very steeply. And I think the role that consumer credit played during that period, particularly in the Anglo-American economies, was that it softened the blow so that the harshness of the actual reimposition of class inequality was papered over by this very elastic thing that is credit––where punishment, during a credit boom, at least, can always be deferred, even while you continue to pay interest. I think there’s all kinds of tradeoffs that happen during this era that are worth picking. It can also account for the fact that we’re now seeing this really hard turn to the far right. I lived in France in the 1990s, and there was not the same expansion of consumer credit as we’ve seen in the United States or Australia, most of the Anglo-American economies. And it’s funny what a different lived experience it was. I mean, nobody was able to deny the fact of growing class inequality in France because you just could not cover over the fact that you had to have money. You couldn’t live off your credit card at all. What happens after Volcker Shock is that that combination of high wage push inflation and disinflation of asset prices that you have in the 1970s, that was experienced as a terrible violence by capitalists. The whole intent of the Volcker Shock was to reverse that dynamic. And it did that very successfully. The Volcker Shock broke the back of wage push inflation and it broke the back of it in a durable, enduring way. The orthodoxy of central banks on monetary policy after that, around the world, becomes inflation targeting and it’s presented in this very neutral way, but the politics of it was that they did not want to relive the wage push inflation of the 1970s, when labor was increasing its share of national income and capital was seeing its share eroded. I mean, that was really what was going on. So the demon becomes inflation, and that is presented in very technocratic terms. But the real fear is wage push inflation. At the same time, you see this very deliberate benign neglect toward asset price inflation. And actually, you see this series of more or less cultivated asset price bubbles, if you can call them that––bubbles isn’t quite the right word. First in stocks and then in housing. And you could look at that and think, God, how long would that be sustainable? Wages stagnating and asset prices inflating and an extreme increase in wealth inequality. This is just not going to last. And the tradeoff was one, the expansion in consumer credit. So Greenspan spelt this out very clearly. As long as we can keep a lid on social spending and on wages, bondholders will feel calm, interest rates will remain low, but that means that there will be a lot of cheap credit. And so ultimately it’s okay for wage earners, because the fact that their wages are going nowhere will be offset by the availability of credit. What can they do with this credit? Well, they can buy into asset price inflation. So you have this promise of a broader democratic participation, in this general kind of updraft of asset prices. And in the 1990s, it was about stock options and private pension funds and pension fund capitalism, and in the 2000s it was about housing. And it was easier to put a social justice slant on that, because it’s true that minorities had been excluded from housing credit until quite late, until the 1970s and that there were parts of the 1970s social movements that were about extending credit. This tradeoff collapsed with the housing crisis, and we’re in a pickle now, because we’re in the state of so-called secular stagnation, which is dangerous for capitalism for another reason. It’s a crisis but it’s not a crisis that has been caused by a militant labor movement. It’s a crisis that has been caused by capitalism’s supreme success. And yet you need some demand. And consumer demand, strangely enough, is what has been keeping this whole thing going for a long time. There’s very little capital investment on the part of corporations. In terms of macroeconomic management, governments find themselves in a real bind because they almost have no other option at the moment than to reignite some form of asset inflation and they’re almost dying for a bit of wage crisis, which is a very interesting situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Have any of these provisional fixes been possible without recourse to the purportedly alter-economic unit of the family? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:It’s interesting to me that we’re seeing people like Larry Summers, who are more or less calling for some kind of restoration of the Fordist family wage, who recognize that democratic capitalism is in trouble because it has been too successful, and when capitalism is too successful, interestingly, capitalists aren’t so interested in so-called productive or income-generating investment. They’re quite happy to sit on their renter incomes and when that tradeoff with consumer credit and rising asset prices and houses becomes unworkable, it becomes politically very dangerous. We do find ourselves in a situation very similar to the 1930s in the sense that the problem is the disinflation of wages, and that poses an economic problem for democratic capitalism because you need some demand to instigate investment. But I think, primarily for people like Larry Summers, the fear is the political threat to a kind of orderly democratic capitalism. He’s really quite visibly afraid of the Trump phenomenon. Of course, any kind of move to some kind of new accumulation regime is always going to involve the family. But it’s interesting to me that he’s not doubling down on the family responsibility solution. What he’s saying is that we need some kind of redistribution to the family again––some kind of family wage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Shifting gears, you tell part of this story through the AIDS crisis. And the Volker Shock, of course, led to this massive economic restructuring which in turn drove a sharp decline in private employer-based health insurance. And these insurance companies at the very same time were imbibing neoliberal ideas about moral hazard and starting to restrict coverage for people infected with HIV and AIDS, which was emerging as a public crisis in the 1980s. And you write that even the medical discovery of AIDS was shaped by class and race. Evidence shows that it was likely that HIV and AIDS was prevalent amongst IV drug users in the 70s, yet was only discovered much later amongst white gay men who had good enough health insurance that the particularities of their illness were recognized by medical professionals. Explain your argument about the political economy of the AIDS crisis and whether it’s fair to say that AIDS was incubated, and its spread facilitated, at the margins of the embattled Fordist family wage system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:The fact that there even was an epidemic only became visible through people’s access to medically-insured health care. So retrospectively, through epidemiological records that were collected from emergency departments and all kinds of sources, it became clear that you were seeing spikes of what were later recognized as indicated diseases for AIDS. Amongst women, in particular, it became evident that these had been seen in the 1970s but because these were affecting drug users and sex workers––so people who often died of undocumented diseases and at most passed through the emergency department wards of public hospitals, none of this had added up to a diagnostic picture. And it was only when there were sufficient number of gay men with solid health insurance who came to some of the premier research hospitals that the fact that there actually was an epidemic became visible. So in a sense, the whole crisis itself was framed by patterns of access and lack of access to health insurance and quality medical care. It’s true that the virus itself affected people on the margins, on the economic margins. The position of gay men within Fordism was peculiar in that they were a real minority––I mean, there were real legal and criminal exclusions––but that doesn’t map on to class in any very easy way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Because weirdly enough, they were subjected to similar patterns of residential segregation as Black Americans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Right, yeah. There’s some very interesting work on the formation of the gay ghetto in the 1960s and 70s, and how exclusion from mortgage finance for single men and women, or for anyone who had a criminal history of being gay, meant that the gay ghettos were often contiguous to racial ghettos. I don’t think that means it was going to mediate a harmony, but it’s an interesting fact that there was this kind of proximity. So in a sense, if you look at the demographics of the early AIDS crisis, it is this margins of the fittest welfare state––I would not conflate the economic marginalization of gay men with racial marginalization, but there was certainly an overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:The neoliberal response to the AIDS crisis is one of the most shocking parts of your book. Richard Posner and Tomas Philipson argued that the net cost of the crisis might be “relatively modest were the disease left to run its course without public intervention.” Because the people it was killing off were poor. Even more disturbingly, they argued that the modes by which HIV was transmitted–– intravenous drug use and sex––meant that there weren’t external social costs outside of private, contractual relationships. And so the price was justly being paid by people who had freely chosen to take risky action. And then, what’s more and even grosser, more horrifying, they argue that a public health intervention to stem the AIDS crisis was unwise because it would lower the cost of irresponsible behavior and thus encourage more of it. They wrote, “anything that lowers the costs of sex will increase the amount of it and an increase in the amount of sexual activity will increase the incidence of AIDS, provided that at least some of  the activity is unsafe.” And so they argued, you write, that the state’s exclusive response to the AIDS crisis should be marriage promotion, including amongst gay people. Why were these supposed libertarians so keen on disciplining gay men’s costly promiscuity within the confines of legally-sanctioned monogamy? And what does this reveal about neoliberalism’s capacity to incorporate what you describe as the anti-normative city of the late Fordist liberation movements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Their recommendation for gay marriage is almost the most shocking part of that book, if you follow a kind of caricatured account of neoliberalism. They were writing at the height of the Reagan era non-response to AIDS, and they were at pains to distinguish themselves from Reagan’s ultraconservative advisors on AIDS, who were up in arms about bathhouses and wanted to quarantine people with HIV. That was not what they were on about. So Foucault was right when he said that these people are not normative and they have no kind of interest in sexual normativity. And that’s true, they have no problem with homosexuality per say. Their problem, again, was with the costs of health spending on the state. And they were afraid that if AIDS was declared a public health emergency, this would trigger massive outlays of public funding. It wasn’t so long that ago that people were talking about single-payer health insurance––perhaps it would revive those arguments. They wanted to shut that down. And so the argument against moral hazard was already available––it was the Virginia School argument against social insurance in general, and because the whole idea of social insurance is no fault, you abstract from classical liberal ideas of fault and tort and you just say, well, accidents happen. They’re a normal part of life. We need to organize and ensure and predict in some way, protect ourselves against them in in aggregate terms. A moral hazard argument that was put forward by a Virginia School economist, Mark Pauly, was that as long as you do this, when you guarantee the social insurance of risks, this means that you’re actually encouraging irresponsible behavior because there’s no cost to the individual. So in some sense you need to install reinstate fault––we need to return to a kind of tort law tradition of individual responsibility. And there’s a purist argument for that, which is, let’s get rid of insurance altogether and go back to tort and litigation. But that’s politically not possible. Really, the effect this had at the margins was to actually corrode the protections that were offered by private insurers who increasingly had recourse to ideas around moral hazard to exclude certain high-risk people from their insurance premiums. In many cases, it was gay men with AIDS. It was a similar argument to the one that Posner and Philipson were making: any reasonable person in the 1980s would be aware that if you have unprotected sex, you are at high risk of contracting HIV; therefore this is an informed decision and your responsibility is your own. You bear the tort or the fault. So what they were interested in was analyzing the sexual encounter as equivalent to any kind of contractual relation. So that much is standard. And what I think might appear surprising, or what I expect will be surprising to my reader because I’m making this specific argument about neoliberalism in the family, is that Posner and Philipson then go on to say, well, to compensate for this, we need the state to promote marriage. Essentially what they’re saying is to compensate for this, we need the state to promote family or spousal responsibility––the idea that you should look for economic security within the context of an intimate relationship, a marital relationship,or a family relationship. And they come up with this idea which is actually kind of recurrent in Chicago School neoliberalism and that is the argument that the most primitive insurance contract––really, this is not comparable to an insurance contract, but this is their argument anyway––the most primitive insurance contract is the couple or the family. So that this, logically, should take the place of social insurance. Basically, their idea is that if you contract HIV and you are fully informed, it’s your fault. If we can just encourage these people to get married and legalize their relationship, then the state will have every right to enforce that relationship as the first line of care, so that the medical costs you incur will fall on your partner, your partner will be responsible for housing you, for caring for you. It’s completely in line with Gary Becker’s idea that the family is a natural insurance mechanism. It’s completely in line with the poor law tradition, but they’re not reflexive enough to say that we are writing this from the point of view of the poor law tradition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:This also leads to the question of where social conservatives and neoliberals diverge, because social conservatives, of course, their response to the AIDS crisis is not that gay people should get married. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You argue that neoliberals on the one hand believe that the family was a fundamental value that would emerge from market forces, whereas social conservatives held that it was the market’s a priori and society’s a priori foundation. You write, “neoliberalism and social conservatism are thus tethered by a working relationship that is at once necessary and disavowed. As an ideology of power that only ever acknowledges its reliance on market mechanisms and their homologs, neoliberalism can only realize its objectives by proxy––that is, by outsourcing the imposition of non-contractual obligations to social conservatives.” This makes me wonder, how is it that social conservatives and neoliberals have viewed each other? Did their convergence around concrete policy ultimately overcome their initial suspicions? You write about Irving Kristol delivering a paper in 1972 at the Mont Pelerin society basically accusing neoliberals of sharing the New Left’s amoralism. Or is it fair to say that the two groupings converge on some institutional levels while remaining autonomous and divergent on others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:What is interesting to me about the Posner and Philipson book, and I think what I would want to correct or qualify Foucault’s characterisation of neoliberals as antinormative, is that combined with their antinormative pity is an insistence that any kind of relationship that is going to cost the state money must be reprivatized within the family or the couple form. And so I propose the notion of this alliance of antinormativity and legitimacy. I’m not quite sure legitimacy is the right word, but I’m trying to get at this strange combination of impulses within their work. They can be completely antinormative and yet have this economic attachment to the family––the family as absolute economic imperative. Some of the responses to my book have been, well, this is a critique of the patriarchal family and of course I have a critique of the patriarchal family. But my point goes beyond that, that this reassertion and reimposition of the family as an economic institution is not necessarily about normativity. It also extends to two people who are trying to be as antinormative as they possibly can, because you just can’t escape the fact that without a thorough redistribution of incomes, and in the context of increasing inequality, we’re all being pushed back into these familial forms of dependence. So building on that uninvolved relationship, it’s really interesting how un-self-reflexive, particularly the Chicago School neoliberals, are about the internal contradictions within their work. The fact that they want to extend contractual relations to every corner of human existence and yet in the last instance, they need this space. They need the family or the couple to serve as this kind of non-contractual bedrock. And they simply commit that contradiction to paper, usually without even remarking on it. It’s simply stating it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:It’s a role similar to primitive accumulation, almost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yeah. There is one interview that Milton Friedman does with PBS, on PBS television, I think, where he talks about the bequest motive of the family as being the foundation of free market capitalism. Of course, this doesn’t make sense within a completely contractual free market order where everyone’s supposedly acting in their self-interest. Why would you be so altruistic as to want to bequeath something to your heirs? And he just says, I confess that this is completely mysterious to me, but it’s kind of like, I’m glad it exists among American neoliberals. The one exception to this is James McGill Buchanan––perhaps the Virginia Achool more generally. And to the extent that I think he is almost a hybrid of neoliberal and conservative, perhaps paleoconservative rather than neoconservative, he does recognize that there needs to be a non-contractual order to the free market system and he does locate the basis of these non-contractual, binding moral engagements in the family. He has this whole kind of parallel corpus which is all about moral philosophy and he is quite explicit about that. In some ways I think he’s closer to the German Ordoliberals, who also are conservatives and economic liberals at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:What about Murray Rothbard and his ilk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yeah, yeah. The paleoconservatives and the paleolibertarians are getting there too––even wilder, because their conservatism is on the fascistic side. But anyway, we won’t even go there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:A different show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yeah. I mean, what is remarkable about the American neoliberals is that you do get these pure types in the academic space. Milton Friedman is about as free market neoliberal as you would get. He’s not normative, as Foucault would say. He’s in favor of the decriminalization of drugs, of sex work. He’s against conscription. He obviously has no problems with gay sex. But it’s very unusual that you find these pure types in the political arena. You almost always find hybrids. So even someone like Ronald Reagan, people would sometimes argue that his social conservatism is a little bit hypocritical, but I’m not sure. He wasn’t a religious conservative, but I think he was certainly paternalistic, and a law and order paternalist. As far as I can see, the most contact that these people had with each other was via political figures. Someone like Ronald Reagan was amazingly in contact with these neoliberal and social conservative scholars, and he had them around on all kinds of business and collaborating on all kinds of different policy projects. And I don’t see them collaborating with each other otherwise. I think they met each other in that context and of course, there’s Angus Burgin, and his bookhas this wonderful chapter on the encounter between Irving Kristol and Milton Friedman. And there wasn’t much love lost between them; in fact, Kristol was one of the earliest critics of Friedman. The alliance was certainly not ready-made in the United States in a way it might have been, say, with German Ordoliberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to turn to the final act of the AIDS story you’re telling, which is the LGBT movement’s capture by neoliberalism, if that’s the right way to phrase it. You write that neoliberals came around to gay marriage before the gay rights movement did. And initially, the leading militant AIDS action group ACT UP had recognizing equities baked into the private insurance system, thanks to the leadership of women and minority caucuses in the organization, and expanded its actions beyond private insurers’ exclusions to look at the broader issue of the need for universal single-payer healthcare. But soon thereafter, you write that the horizon was suddenly curtailed quite dramatically, and the movement shifted its focus to ensuring gay inclusion in marriage so as to access the class-exclusionary private healthcare system. And you write, “at a time of shrinking political horizons, same-sex marriage proponents looked at the surviving remnants of the family wage social insurance benefits premised on marital and familial status to argue that they too should be included in this last vestige of forced normativity. The call to recognize same-sex marriage thus becomes a demand for inclusion within a family wage system that is itself in terminal decline. What prompted this dramatic shift and what was its impact on the liberatory potential of the LGBT movement in particular and of queerness in general?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:There was some interesting health insurance activism within ACT UP, from the margins, which was was news to me. I guess it lost steam along with Clinton’s efforts to introduce some form of universal health insurance. I can see within the context that it would have been very difficult and very utopian at the time, in the 90s, to set your hopes any higher. It’s an incredible loss and it’s an incredible step backwards in terms of reimagining public health, which is what the ACT UP movement at its most interesting was about, and so later, when you get the same-sex marriage arguments, many of them are explicitly about ensuring the right for same-sex couples to share the workplace health insurance benefits of their partner. Which makes perfect sense. I mean, I have nothing against that. But it’s remarkable that horizons shrank so much during that period. And it was symptomatic of a defeat of the left in general. I don’t think it’s the same now, but at the time, that was symptomatic. But beyond, when you look at a lot of the legal arguments against DOMA, against the Defense of Marriage Act, they were even more aggressive than their social insurance family wage argument. They were about arguing that if you give us the right to same-sex marriage, if you legalize our relationships, we will be less of a burden on the state than we would otherwise be. So it was absolutely the Posner/ Philipson argument in favor of same-sex marriage. In terms of queerness, I guess it’s that pincer movement I’m talking about, or that kind of simultaneous opening to antinormativity, because these look like moments, and these are decades, in which, at a general social level, antinormative queer relationships become more acceptable, and at the same time they become acceptable by virtue of the fact that they’re being funneled into this family responsibility form. There’s this funny disjuncture which I think is very typical of American neoliberalism, which is antinormativity combined with family responsibility or marital responsibility. I think that in Anglo-Saxon economies more generally, the experience of the recent history of queerness is precisely that: an openness to antinormativity combined with an extreme restriction of the institutional space and extreme privatization of the space in which that can express itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You write that others misread the state of family life under capitalism by making the case that neoliberalism has been destructive of family life, or even that revolts against normativity––familial normativity– beginning in the 60s pave the way for neoliberalism. This is an interesting argument and I’d like to unpack it a little. There are both light and heavy takes along these lines that you identify, perhaps the most explicit being from German political economist Wolfgang Streeck. Streeck argues, according to your reading, and I haven’t read this directly so I’m reading it through you, that the breakdown in the marriage contract facilitated the liberalization of markets because it destroyed the constituency for the Fordist family wage, which was the wage-earning man and dependent wife. You also argue that Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, the authors of, fall into a similar, if less brazenly anti-feminist, version of the trap by arguing that it was the countercultural left that cleared the way for neoliberalism. You argue on both accounts that the opposite is true, that in fact these new liberation movements weren’t useful idiots for neoliberalism. Explain the disagreement and and your take on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:Yes, I thought it was really important to counter this argument because it was building up a lot of steam. It was starting to become common sense and I think it’s extremely dangerous. I think it’s striking to me because it’s also a far-right argument that the problem with capitalism is liberalism––understood as cultural liberalism, understood as the dissolution of borders or boundaries, and that can be the borders of the nation, or hierarchies of gender. And obviously this is a very dangerous argument at the current moment, so I think it really needs to be contested forcefully. So the argument––it makes total sense, if you accept that the working class is the working class family and if you accept that the working class family naturally implies the dependence of women on men. And in that sense Streeck is completely right. Feminism, in as much as it contributed to a breakdown of family law and the Fordist family form, destroyed the economic security of the male breadwinner wage. That’s absolutely true. And feminism would have been a pathetic movement if it hadn’t accomplished that. But if you don’t accept that women should be dependent on the male wage, then the question does not even pose itself. I mean Boltanski and Chiapello are very clear about the move they’re making. They’re separating what they call the liberation and freedom movements from the movements for security, and then when it comes to listing what these liberation and freedom movements are, of course, it’s feminism and gay liberation and the movements for security are all about the labor movement. Of course, it’s a completely false distinction, but that allows you to say that the specific wrong of neoliberalism is the fact that it’s destabilized gender and sexual hierarchies. I think racial hierarchies are in there too. And so once you’ve identified that specific ill, your remedy is as much about restoring those hierarchies as it is about redistribution. It’s some kind of restoration of the family wage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:You even argue that Nancy Fraser falls in to a similar line of argument, though without directly calling for the revival of the Fordist family wage. This reads Fraser a bit differently than I have, though I’m sure you’ve read more of her, so I’m going to let Kate Doyle Griffiths, who published a response to your critique of Fraser and social reproduction theory––I’m going to let her ask my question through me. She wrote a critique, or a response to you, on the Verso blog. First, she argues that your argument that social reproduction theory naturalizes a feminine reproductive sphere is the opposite of the social reproduction theory that that she is familiar with, and then she argues that, with regard to your critique of Marx along these lines, that you take his family analysis at its worst, which certainly exists, and neglect his call for the abolition of the bourgeois family. What’s your take on her response to your work on the social reproduction debate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:So there is a lot of indecision in Marx’s work, but I do think that the passage in Volume I of Capital, where he’s talking about the working day and the Factory Acts and he’s very much in favor of Tory paternalistic moves to get women out of the factories…I think that’s very significant and telling about his stance on the male breadwinner wage, and it’s extremely uncritical. What I find interesting about that passage is that earlier in the book, he has a kind of ideal typical account. He sets up this conceptual division between production and reproduction, and I think that a lot of the feminist theorizing around social reproduction actually comes from that, rather than Volume II of Capital. That in itself to me is interesting, that Marx is working with this conceptual ideal division between production and reproduction that he takes as given in the first part of Volume I, and then in the second part of Volume I, you discover that, in fact, women at the very time he is writing are employed en masse in the factories, and that precisely what one part of the male trade union movement, including Marx, is up in arms about, and what they share with Tory paternalists, is the idea that the fact of women’s labor is undermining the reproduction of the working class family. You can see that the problem for them was the fact that women’s work was dangerously unreproductive, or anti-reproductive, and that a lot of work had to be performed to instate this division between production and reproduction that Marx offers up as if it was some kind ofin the beginning of the same book. I should be clear that I’m indebted to a lot of Marxist feminist literature, and a lot of the work that flies under the banner of social reproduction theory is extremely interesting in the details of analysis, but I think there’s something about the term and the framing of the idea of social reproduction that is limiting, because it makes it difficult to theorize these moments when the division between production and reproduction is set up, and it’s continuously being set up and reimposed, and it also makes it difficult to understand women’s labor as anything but reproductive––and that’s not at all self-evident. The moments when women’s labor is most politicized and most politically fraught is when it’s perceived as being unreproproductive or anti-reproductive, and that can be any kind of labor. It can be care work, it can be being an engineer, it can be…it seems to me that the very framing of social reproduction, the terms of analysis, are unnecessarily confining and seem to posit that something has been accomplished where we should actually be theorizing the process of accomplishment, if you like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:The roots of what you describe as this left misanalysis of the relationship between the family and neoliberalism, you find those in Karl Polanyi and his famous argument about capitalism’s double movement, which is that capitalism, and I’ll quote from you here, “strives to include what was once inalienable within the ambit of exchange value.” And you argue that the double movement that Polanyi describes is in fact internal to capitalism, that “economic liberalism and political conservatism, even when the latter speaks the language of anti-capitalist critique, are equally constitutive expressions of modern capitalism.” Can you explain the distinction that you’re drawing between something that moves against capitalism, as Polanyi would have it, versus a contradiction that is imminent to it, and how that distinction elucidates your take on Marxist theories of fundamental value, about the fundamental importance that entails this reinventing of the traditions, of the institutions, of race, family, and nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:These things that people call the “inalienable” or the “non-contractual,” these are not outside of capitalism. You can’t harness them as a way of hauling yourself outside of capitalism. And when people make nostalgic gestures towards the unalienable or the non-contractual, or even the non-commodified, you need to be very skeptical. What I find really fascinating and exciting about Marx’s quandary is the fact that in various suggestive, if very abstract, ways, he provides us with the means for understanding how capitalism is both anti-foundational and foundation-forming––constantly foundation-forming. And he presents this in terms of an analysis of limits. And so in a very abstract way, he tells us that, yes, capitalism is this boundless movement to overcome the limit, the border. But at the very same time, it needs to impose it. Now that sounds extremely abstract, but what I think it helps us to think is that…take a conversation that has been very…to the fore recently, is capitalism about dissolving national borders? Is capitalism a threat to the nation state, and should we contest it on that grounds? Because once we’ve set up the question in that way, the only response is nationalism. And the only response is border protection. And so the capitalism of the right and the far-right is to say that the migrants are a symptom of capitalism; therefore we need to expel migrants. We need to reinstate the border. And that is anti-capitalism. But of course, the status of migrants as cheap labor––and they’re certainly used as cheap labor and leveraged as cheap labor, in exactly the ways that trade union movements have identified. But the fact that migrants become cheap labor has nothing to do with any natural qualities inherent in the migrant but through the very fact of the imposition of the border. So it’s as if this positing of the nation as foundational, at the same time as migration and movement across borders is permitted, is what constitutes the migrant as cheap labor. So you have this double movement of imposition of the border and facilitation of free movement. Relatively free movement, I should put it. So I think there is a same kind of dynamic with the family. There’s one argument, and it’s certainly true in specific historical moments, that, say, industrialists have wanted women in the factories because women are cheap. But why were young women such cheap labor? It was because there was a general social consensus that, in fact, they should be in the home and that they had no right to be in the trade union movement. So in fact capitalism is constituted both by the kind of deterritorialization of women from the home––the departure of women from the home––and this general social consensus, insistence, that they should be in the home. There’s a movement to unmake foundations and to reassert them at the same time. And I think what’s so difficult about left critique, like a true left critique is very uncomfortable because you have to be anti-liberal and anti-conservative at the same time, and I think it’s very dangerous at a moment like this to be mimicking the conservative critique of capitalism. So to get all nostalgic about the family or the nation. I would have said a different thing in the 90s, you know when I say, I have a critique of Nancy Fraser and Boltanski and Chiapello implying that queerness is somehow expressive of capitalism. I don’t mean that there isn’t a neoliberal queer movement and a neoliberal queerness, and that that wasn’t dominant in the 1990s––of course it was. It’s just that I don’t think queerness in itself is symptomatic of capitalism any more than I think Jews are symptomatic of capitalism. In the 90s I would have thought that a lot of academic queer theory was dangerously uncritical of liberalism. I think there’s almost a kind of pendulum movement, dare I say, a double movement between the left either cozying up to liberalism or cozying up to conservatism, whereas a left critique needs to be a double critique, if capitalism’s tendencies are kind of a double tendency, this simultaneous liberalism and conservatism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to ask about the familial political-economic politics underlying Trump’s victory and governance. There’s a lot to work with here: we have the miner and factory worker as symbolic of the lost Fordist family wage. We have this instrumental incorporation of religious conservatives who were eager to put women back in their place and ensure religion’s place as an institutional force backed by the state. And then there’s this more basic familiarity of Trump’s nationalism, with him as this belligerently protective patriarch. Where does Trump fit into your history? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:It’s true that his appeals to Fordist familialism turn out to be purely symbolic, which is not so surprising. I think that he does exemplify this alliance between neoliberalism and conservatism that I identify in my book, but not the specific currents. He’s kind of invigorated…with what we were just talking about, this very extreme and hitherto-marginal strand of American neoliberalism, which even people like Friedman consider loonies, and that is the American-Austrian neoliberals––so the Americans who were inspired by von Mises. So Murray Rothbard, who in turn is like a, he’s not at all a neoconservative, he’s a paleoconservative. He’s going back to that pre-civil rights, anti-civil rights, deeply anti-Semitic, white supremacist genre of conservatism that the neoconservatives, as secular Jews, thought was anathema. I think there’s that particular current that perhaps hasn’t been analyzed enough yet and that has all kinds of connections to the old right. But there’s also the fact that Trump just revived a very basic kind of supply-side economics. In those terms, he’s true to form, he’s just accelerated a tendency for extremely regressive tax cuts that you saw under Bush and Reagan. And in terms of familial politics, there is the religious influence too, and he’s obviously kept the evangelicals on board. I don’t think that they’ve triumphed in the way that they have wanted to. And I think perhaps the lasting influence of Trump in terms of gender and sexual politics will be to have enabled the old right to sow a far-right inflection to conservatism, if you can even call it conservatism at this point, because it has a kind of libertarian edge as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:My last question is: your book consistently notes the convergence of people who believe that market discipline binds the family and those who believe that state support does, but your normative argument gets a little buried, maybe. So I wonder, what’s your normative ideal of the family or must it be abolished? And if the family need be abolished, must kinship relations as we know them be abolished as well? And whatever the case may be, what’s your vision of a left politics that in practice does what your analysis does, which is obviate the distinctions of superstructure versus structure and identity versus economic location? And as a result, attempts to transform the totality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MC:I don’t have a normative politics of the family. I don’t want to abolish it or anything. I don’t care enough. But I guess my grievance is that there’s this extreme economic weight on the family, which means that those who want to or have to escape it can’t anymore. And so I do need to write something, I feel, because a lot of the questions about this book have pointed to my position on welfare. I feel that there are questions about welfare and what revolution means. I feel that there is a question of what revolution means that needs to be rethought, post-fiscal state, and that hasn’t quite been rethought post-fiscal state. It seems to me that our intuitive understandings of revolution are pre-fiscal state, so pre the massive redistribution of incomes and wealth. And I don’t think you can get around that. So I do have a lot more interest in welfare and fiscal policy as sites of radical left politics than others do. But I need to clarify that, I think, because I do think generous and explicitly redistributive public spending is necessary to lift this weight off the family. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Trump and fossil-fueled conservatives have pit working-class prosperity against environmentalism. This, of course, is incredibly dangerous. It’s also premised on a misreading of environmental politics as having nothing to do with human wellbeing. But climate change, of course, threatens not only non-human nature but also the entirety of human life that is fundamentally dependent on it. Right now, coastal homes and cities, agriculture, wildfire-prone forests, and the water supply are all under threat. And so an ecologically-sustainable response to this crisis must definitionally also be a socially and economically just one: something like a Green New Deal, a broad vision that climate activists and left insurgent politicians are uniting behind. Dan’s guest today, climate reporter Kate Aronoff, is going to tell us all about it—as well as about the general state of domestic and global climate politics.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Guns in general, and American gun culture in particular, have created a horrific bloodbath. But much of the liberal gun control movement has, in concert with the NRA and Republican Right, worked to make the war on guns a central facet of mass incarceration. The upshot is that we have the worst of both worlds: a society flooded with guns, where the paradigmatic white “good guy with a gun” treasures his weapons as a bedrock constitutional right even as the supposed “bad guys with a gun,” often black men with a felony record, are mercilessly prosecuted for carrying. Dan talks to reporter George Joseph, who has a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/jeff-sessions-gun-prosecutions.html&quot;&gt;new piece up at&lt;/a&gt; on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ war on guns, which has led to a sharp increase in federal gun prosecutions—often hitting ordinary black men with felony records who are simply carrying for their own protection.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Black Lives Matter is a poignant slogan and a powerful force for social transformation. It’s also shorthand for a huge array of organizations, mostly led by people that you’ve never heard of, working the daily hard grind of ordinary organizing that stitches together spectacular mass actions into a movement. That’s the subject of the new book 
by Dan’s guest, historian and activist Barbara Ransby.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A History of Neoliberalism with Quinn Slobodian</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Neoliberalism: we all hate it, but what does it mean? Dan talks to intellectual historian Quinn Slobodian about his book 
, which tells the story of neoliberalism’s Geneva School—including Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Wilhelm Röpke—and their vision for a new imperial order establishing rules to protect the market from political interference. It’s a movement that begins with nostalgia for the bygone Habsburg Empire, moves on to fights against the decolonized world’s efforts to create a New International Economic Order, and that plays a key role in forming the European Economic Community and the WTO.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Roots of White Power Violence with Kathleen Belew</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The man who carried out the massacre in Pittsburgh was apparently motivated by a belief that Jewish people were conspiring to destroy the white race by way of orchestrating mass immigration. It’s a conspiracy theory with deep roots in America’s violent white power movement and that today is echoed by Trump and

&lt;p&gt;Historian Howard Zinn died in 2010. Today, he remains a model for left-wing intellectuals in how to both convey ideas to a public beyond academia and how to take direct action to transform the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching at Spelman, a black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Zinn supported and advised the student sit-in movement. During the war on Vietnam, he traveled to Hanoi to receive American prisoners whom the North Vietnamese had shot out of the sky. And he published 
A People’s History of the United States, a book that prompted many readers to, for the very first time, see the United States’s foundational myths of American innocence and meritocratic reward as lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Eric Foner wrote in an obituary for the Nation, “Few historians managed to reach a broad non-academic audience. Those who do generally write monumental history, works that celebrate great men or heroic events. Zinn’s history was different. . . . Zinn’s public learned about ordinary American struggles for justice, equality and power.” Foner continued,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long been struck by how many excellent students of history first had their passion for the past sparked by reading Howard Zinn. Sometimes, to be sure, his account tended toward the Manichaean, an oversimplified narrative of the battle between the forces of light and darkness. But 
A People’s History taught an inspiring and salutary lesson — that despite all too frequent repression, if America has a history to celebrate it lies in the social movements that have made this a better country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, professor of African-American studies at Princeton University, has written a foreword to a new edition of 
You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train, Zinn’s autobiography. Daniel Denvir spoke with Taylor about Zinn’s life and legacy for his podcast the Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historian Howard Zinn remains a model for left-wing intellectuals who want to not only convey ideas to a public beyond academia but also take action to transform the world that it is their profession to explain.

   <title>Madawi al-Rasheed on Saudi Royal Brutality</title>

   <updated>2018-10-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/madawi-al-rasheed-on-saudi-royal-brutality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The brutality of the Saudi royal family had been hiding in plain sight. It was an open secret convenient to the political, media and business elites for whom the Kingdom means big business and an invaluable geostrategic proxy. But the brutal murder and dismemberment of a single 
 columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, has forced Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman and his American enablers onto the defensive as the regime’s brutal war on Yemen, global support for Salafist fundamentalism, and kleptocratric repression have suddenly been subjected to intense public scrutiny. Dissident scholar Madawi al-Rasheed explains the history and political-economy of Saudi Arabia, and the now-frustrated efforts at obfuscation mounted by bin Salman and his allies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dan spoke to Nikhil Pal Singh about the unfortunate and never-ending debate over whether it was economics or racism that got Trump elected. This is a sequel to that discussion: because what Malaika Jabali powerfully exposes in a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/10/the-color-of-economic-anxiety&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; combining on-the-ground reporting in Milwaukee and historical and data analysis is that when we talk about the impact of economic crisis on Trump’s victory, the condition of Black poor and working-class people—many of whom decided to stay home on election day—must be at its center.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jacobin Managing Editor Micah Uetricht pulls Dave-Davies-duty for Dan and interviews Rossana Rodríguez-Sanchez, a DSA member running for alderwoman in Chicago. Rodríguez-Sanchez moved to Chicago from Puerto Rico, where the brutal austerity imposed on the island made her job as a teacher impossible. She has brought with her a radical tradition and a program to fight for the city’s beleaguered public schools, for renters and for immigrant rights, and for a public safety agenda that prioritizes social workers over cops.&lt;/p&gt;

StartFragmentBrazil is headed toward fascism by way of Jair Bolsonaro, a sexist, homophobic, and violent militarist clown nostalgic for a murderous dictatorship. How did this happen? Alfredo Saad-Filho, a Professor of Political Economy at SOAS University of London, explains the roots of right-wing reaction and left-wing collapse—and the ultimately disastrous results of a PT governance strategy centered on an accommodation with a capitalist order that could only last as long as the global commodity boom did.&lt;/mce:style&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sawant on Socialism Against the Amazonification of Seattle</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Socialist Alternative’s Kshama Sawant was elected to Seattle City Council way before socialism became a cool thing. 
Today, Dan’s talking to Sawant about how socialists can build power and win at the local level—and how in Seattle, that means taking on Amazon, which recently coerced her colleagues on Council to reverse themselves on a big-business tax that was earmarked to help the homeless people who have been squeezed out of the housing market by an economy dominated by those very same big businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christine Blasey Ford and other women have revealed that our political-economic elite is pervaded by profound intimate violence, forms of brutal interpersonal domination that are the everyday and microcosmic connective tissue of systems of domination as a whole. Lisa Duggan offers her thoughts on how to link these individual stories that playing out at economic, political and celebrity peaks to the systems that order the world that the rest of us live in. Duggan also addresses carceral feminism and how “believe women” obscures the way that gender and sexuality are embedded in political and economic structures.

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Denvir:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalism: A Conversation in Critical Theory,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalism: A Conversation in Critical Theory,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD: Nancy Fraser, welcome to The Dig. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy Fraser:Thanks, it’s a pleasure to be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Your Marxism is a refreshingly comprehensive one. You argue, if I can take a stab at summarizing your argument, that the exploitation of labor in the realm of production, which is what’s most familiar to many Marxists, critically depends upon three key things that are shunted off into the background. First, social reproduction, which most notably, but by no means exclusively, includes home lives, where humans eat, sleep, socialize, where children are reared. Second, politics, which includes everything from the market-creating and defending activities of government, to the carceral state. And then, non-human nature, which is both this critical source of raw materials for capitalists, but also a dumpster for their waste. And some orthodox variants of Marxism don’t pay much attention to these things, in part, it seems to me, ironically, because capitalism mystifies and denies the fact that it depends upon these spheres. Explain this big picture of capitalism you are arguing for, something that is, in your analysis, far more than a merely economic system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:You’re right. There is a tendency to think of capitalism as an economic system, and then we think that if we’re engaged, say, on the left, in trying to criticize capitalism, we’re criticizing how production is organized, how wealth is distributed, how class power in the workplace is wielded, and so on. Now, all of those things are extremely important, but they’re not the whole story, because the official economy within a capitalist society depends on a background of social relations, social practices, institutions, that are regarded as non-economic. In fact, I would say that one thing that is really definitive of capitalist societies, which distinguishes those societies from others, is precisely the centrality of this distinction between what is truly economic and what is non-economic. That’s not a distinction that’s somehow given by nature; it is a socially constructed distinction, and one that is institutionalized with real material and political force in capitalist societies. So all the work, as you mentioned, of birthing and raising children, of schooling them, of feeding them, of cleaning them, of socializing them, all the work of caring for other family members, whether we’re talking about healthy and able working adults or aging or invalid parents and others––all of that is considered non-economic and outside of the capitalist economy unless we get to a point, which we’ve arrived at, at least to some degree, today, where that work is commodified and becomes wage work. But in and of itself, it’s always taken a back seat and, as you say, shoved into the background. And when we think we’re talking about and criticizing capitalism, we’re ignoring all that. We’re also ignoring all of these questions about how public power, the power of states, of global financial and political institutions, of police, how all of that power is organized and is also a necessary precondition for the functioning of a capitalist economy, in the narrow sense. And the third thing you mentioned, non-human nature, is seen, from the capitalist economic point of view, as a repository of raw material stuff that we can just take, funnel into production, use up, exhaust, not worry about replenishing, as if it’s just an infinitely available gift. And then, as you say, to be used also as a dumpster, as just a place to dump waste, of which we generate an enormous amount. So, if you take what I call an “expanded view” of what capitalism is, you come to the point where you say: we can’t understand how even the narrow economy functions if we don’t look at the ways in which it relies on and depends upon inputs from the system of care or social reproduction, from the system of nature, from the various political systems. The economy doesn’t work without those things. And my proposal is that instead of interpreting capitalism as an economic system, we should see it as the name for something much bigger. I call it an “institutionalized social order,” and I think you could get a sense of what I mean by that if you just contrast it to feudalism. Capitalism is something as big as and on a par with feudalism. And in both cases, the question is: how are things that we might think of as economic functions organized in relation to other functions, equally necessary to society and to the economic––that are split off, hived off, called something else, located in different institutions, assigned to different people, compensated differently if at all, and in a way that is shot through and through with asymmetrical power relations––with relations of domination? Just to finish this maybe overly long answer, I would say that one advantage of taking this expanded view of capitalism is that you get to see how entrenched relations of domination other than the ones that Marxists have traditionally focused on, namely class (understood in an economistic way), are also inseparable from, and structurally grounded in, capitalist societies. And that includes relations of gender dominance and subordination; that obviously has everything to do with the division between economic production, on the one side, and social reproduction, on the other. We could say a little bit more about how race and imperial domination fit into this picture, but that too is equally structural. And obviously, ecological depredation and destruction is built into this picture. So, we’ve got a broader array of axes of domination and I could go on and say, also, a broader array of flashpoints of trouble and nodes of crisis. There’s much more going on in capitalist society than the traditional economistic picture suggests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD: 
There’s a lot there, obviously, and a lot in your book. I want to start with social reproduction, which has been the focus of the work for a lot of your career. And I want you to explain a little bit more about what that is, and how it differs from forms of patriarchy that have existed outside of capitalism. And then, concretely, I’d like you to explain what the crisis, or maybe better put, crises, of social reproduction look like in the United States today. Because one core contradiction, or crisis tendency, in capitalism, that you touched on briefly in your first comment there, is that the drive to accumulate more capital means that all of these prerequisites that capitalism depends upon but denies are always threatened with commodification and destruction. So, I’d like you to lay out these current crises in social reproduction, and why it is that capitalism is driven to undermine its very conditions of existence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Sure, absolutely. It’s a complicated question, but I think an extremely important one that provides us, if we can get a proper handle on it, with a lot of insight into what’s going on today politically in the United States. But let me start with the general issue of, what is social reproduction? At one level, social reproduction just means all of the activities and energies and social relations that go into producing, socializing, and reproducing human beings and social bonds––everything that connects people to one another in social life. And social reproduction, in this very general sense, exists in every society, in every form, in free capitalist societies and socialist societies and so on. Now, what is specific though is how social reproduction is organized in capitalist societies. And as I said just before, the most important starting point here is this idea that we separate it from what we call “economic production.” In one case people “go out to work,” to an office, to a factory, to a mine, to a field. In another case, they stay at home. So we already have this huge division between the household and the workplace, between the family and the factory, and this division correlates, historically, with gender, with the sphere of women and the sphere of men. It’s this split between production and reproduction that is distinctive, or it’s one of the splits that’s distinctive, about capitalist society. In previous societies, women’s work was often distinguished from men’s work. They didn’t do exactly the same things, but they did it, more or less, in the same space of the extended household or the village or community. And there was no sense that women’s work was somehow occluded, made invisible, seen as not contributing. But with the emergence of capitalism, and especially these various Victorian ideologies and middle-class ideals of female domesticity, then you got the idea that that women weren’t really even working at all. They were just adorning or diffusing fine moral sentiments throughout society. This is all a huge mystification. Some Marxist feminists, just to clarify, have thought of social reproductive labor exclusively as housework. I think that’s too narrow. It’s not just about cleaning and cooking and washing within the confines of a private family home. Social reproduction should also be thought of as including schools and whatever public institutions that create social bonds––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Playgrounds, community centers, block parties–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Playgrounds, community centers; hospitals and medical clinics are also sites of social reproduction. In any case, it’s a vast expanse of social activity. But for the most part, and this is another distinctive feature of capitalism, unless it’s brought inside the economy and treated as a way to make a profit, it’s not counted as having any value. And most of social reproduction––all of these things I’ve talked about––is still outside the formal economy. It’s seen as not having a value. So that’s the other thing about what capitalism values. Since the whole raison d’être of the system is precisely to accumulate profits and thereby to expand capital, that’s the sole measure of value. And this brings me to the point you were just asking about having to do with crisis tendencies. You can see that there’s a built-in, hardwired imperative to maximize your profit and increase your capital, if you have any. And that means trying to find, and touch on, inputs that you can use in the process of capital accumulation for which you don’t pay at all or you pay at under the cost of their replacement. Capital is structurally primed to try to avoid paying the replacement costs of the inputs that it utilizes in the process of production, including immaterial production. So, that means not paying the full ecological replacement costs of raw materials or of the damage that’s done through waste dumping, including carbon emissions. It also means not paying the full replacement costs of the work of social reproduction. So, we know that housework has overwhelmingly been unpaid or very poorly paid and underpaid; paid less than the cost of reproducing the woman who performs it. That difference between what capital gets out of that work, even indirectly, and what is paid for it, is a nice little windfall, a freebie, that makes capitalist production more profitable. I’m just trying to describe a logic that is built into a system that works this way, where you’re always trying to pay as little as possible. So over time, what can happen, is that there is a systemwide failure to invest in social reproduction. Capital doesn’t want to pay. It doesn’t want to pay its workers enough to allow them to pay a decent wage for personal housework, for example, or childcare. Corporations don’t want to pay the taxes, generous enough taxes, to fund generous high-quality public services, such as a childcare or education and so on. So there’s a constant chiseling away at this. And it can go so far, under certain conditions, that you actually endanger society’s capacity to reproduce itself in this human social sense. This is a case of just eating into the bone of something. And we know from, let’s say, Engels’ great work,how this looked in the 19th century in an early phase of capitalism, where the new industries were just basically dragooning women and children into factories and mines along with men. In fact, they loved child labor and women’s labor because they thought they could pay less and they thought that these would be docile workers who wouldn’t make trouble. In any case, you got in this situation a real crisis of social reproduction, where the working class was really not able to reproduce itself, to turn out laborers with the health and the skills and those human capacities that were needed. And it provoked an enormous amount of political conflict and struggle and organizing, aimed first at passing protective legislation and other laws limiting hours, and minimum wage laws, and health and safety laws, and so on and so forth. All of that was an attempt to try to draw some boundaries and bolster the processes of social reproduction, which capital, left to itself, was depleting and destroying. That 19th century–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And this is a core crisis tendency that you identify as “boundary struggles.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Yes. I coined this phrase “boundary struggles” to try to give a name to a kind of struggle that is built into capitalist society precisely around these institutionalized divisions; division between production and reproduction, between the economy and the political system, between non-human nature and human society, which is supposed to not be natural. The point is, these are divisions that are definitive and constitutive of capitalist society. They are structural. And they are also points, locations in society, where conflict congregates. Where should we draw the line between production and reproduction? These struggles, that I just mentioned, over protective legislation in the 19th and 20th century, were struggles over just that question. And they were at the same time struggles over, what’s the boundary between the state and the market? Should the state step in and say, “No, you have to have minimum wage. You have to have a health and safety regime. You have to have accident insurance. You have to limit hours and so on so forth.” These are very familiar kinds of conflicts, but I think it clarifies to think of them as boundary struggles, struggles over where to draw the line between reproduction and production, polity and economy, nature and society. I think that the usual Marxian story about class struggle, while very powerful and absolutely pertinent to our time as well, doesn’t fully account for struggles outside the workplace proper, which could also be thought of class struggles if we had a wider sense of what we meant by class, but that are, in any case, boundary struggles. But if we go back to the question of social reproduction today, what’s very important is that we’ve transitioned, within the last, say, 50 years, to a new form of capitalism. Well, I guess if it’s 50 years it’s maybe not so new anymore, but it’s been called neoliberalism. I prefer to call it financialized capitalism. Whatever we call it, it’s very different from the previous regime of capitalism which flourished, at least in the U.S., from the New Deal, and elsewhere, at least in the aftermath of the Second World War. I call that state-managed capitalism. You could call it social-democratic capitalism. Some people used to call it monopoly capitalism, many names, but the key idea of that New Deal or state-managed capitalism was that the state weighed in, in support of social reproduction. It said: okay, we’re not going to let that pursuit of profit run entirely roughshod over people’s ability to have a life and even to generate new workers that capital wants down the line. We’re going to throw some ballast on the scale, some weight on the scale. We’re going to tax capital. We’re going to pay for schooling. And we’re going to insist that wage levels be at a certain level to allow for a home life and so on. I want to be clear that I am the last person to say that this New Deal, or state-managed regime was a golden age of any kind. It was premised on a lot of built-in domination. It was premised on women’s subordination, through the idea of the family wage, the idea that a working man should be paid a salary sufficient to support his non-employed wife and children, so that a family should need only one salary, one worker. That, at one level, seems like a luxury to us today. But at another level, it was premised on a male-dominated household model in which women were dependent on men. It was also premised on––now we do get to the more traditional sense of imperialism––the ability of the wealthy states of the capitalist core to siphon value from what was then called the Third World, what we today called the Global South. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to ask you about the interstate system and imperialism because that’s one of a few different divisions that, if I read you right, are subsets of, though by no means secondary to, the three key divisions that you identify between production and reproduction, economy and polity, and human and non-human nature. And one of these key divisions, that is a subset, but not secondary, is that between domestic and international, and core and periphery. And those two divisions are also key because they’re reproduced inside the United States and other Global North nation states by way of racism and also the racialized legal caste system, more segmented labor market, of illegalized immigrant labor. You identify race and racism and, I think, also an unequal predatory interstate system as core features of capitalism. How do they then relate to the three major distinctions you articulate? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:I said earlier that gender dominance and subordination is hardwired into capitalism as we’ve known it. And I would say the same is true for racial ethnic dominance and subordination. Racial oppression is not contingently or accidentally related to capitalism, but is structurally inscribed in it. And the reason, as I understand it, has to do with the logic I was describing a minute ago, and that is that capital has a stake, always, in expropriating labor forces and raw materials and other assets, for which it doesn’t fully pay. So you have, on the one hand––capitalism developed in a dualized way, historically. On the one hand, you have the iconic working men whom we think of, who go to the factory and get a wage equal to the costs of their social reproduction and so on. On the other hand, you have a much larger population, a much larger story of people who are not in wage labor, in anything remotely like that, but whose assets are simply being seized in one way or another by capital, by imperial and colonial states, or even by their own states in our time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And this is accumulation by dispossession, which is the continuous, persistent version of primitive accumulation, which is more of the historically specific––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Yes––&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Version of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Exactly. This phrase “accumulation by dispossession” is David Harvey’s phrase and it’s a good one. I’ve preferred, though, to speak about expropriation versus exploitation. Let me quote a phrase that I love from Jason Moore, the eco-Marxist critic. He writes, “Behind Manchester stands Mississippi.” So that’s a beautiful phrase. It’s so succinct. What it means is that you don’t have the ability to profitably exploit factory labor in the great textile mills of Manchester without the raw material of cotton produced by slaves in Mississippi. That cheapens the crucial input, the raw material, for the textile production. It also helps to have slave-produced sugar, and tobacco, and rum, and other commodities that allow you to pay lower wages because you have cheap consumer goods, so to speak. So the point is, exploitation and expropriation have always been intertwined in the history of capitalism. They still are today. But roughly, and overall, that distinction has corresponded to what Du Bois famously called “the color line.” It has been overwhelmingly people of color who found themselves on the expropriation side of the boundary and people who were called whites, or Europeans, or metropolitans, who found themselves on the exploitation side. Exploitation was no picnic, but it’s still a more privileged position than that of expropriation. And I think that division is the fundamental structural basis of racial oppression in capitalist society. It’s not just an economic distinction; it’s not that one gets paid and the other, not. It’s also that one is free and the other is dependent or enslaved, subjugated, whether as a colonial subject or a piece of chattel property. Marx insists that wage labor––the workers are free to sign a labor contract. They have a certain level of rights, even if they don’t have the material means to exercise these in a fully free way. The expropriated subjects––and this is the very meaning of expropriation––they don’t have rights. They don’t have protections. Their persons, property, lands, animals, children, can simply be seized. And there’s nobody, no power, they can call upon to protect them, to draw the line. So to be expropriatable means to be inherently subject to violation. And that’s another important meaning of racialization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Your analysis on this reminded me of an insight from Barbara Fields, which is how racism is a result of the contradictions between, I guess what you would describe as, the political and economic spheres of liberal capitalism. You have liberal democracy, proclaiming liberty and some sort of equality for all, but you have this economy that’s obviously brutally unequal, most extremely so with the expropriated labor of African slaves. And then so racism is a sort of provisional solution to this contradiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:There is a contradiction, I would say, in that unlike feudalism and of other forms of ancient slave societies, capitalism really depends on the idea that the official working class, those who are recognized as workers, are free individuals. They, in time, acquire citizenship rights. They get the vote. I mean, they have to struggle for it, but they get the vote. And they get civil rights and other rights. On the other hand, capitalism doesn’t work without this substrate and without this background, this hidden abode. It’s the sort of analogue, in a way, of the housewife. In a sense, you could say her labor is, if not expropriated, at least appropriated, by capital. And on the other hand, you have these vast swaths of humanity throughout the world––as you say, overseas––in colonies and post-colonies, but also the so-called colony within the core, the periphery within the core. You know, there used to be a whole theory about the black colony within the U.S. in African-American liberation thought. So I would say that the freedom of the worker––which is, of course, the freedom to be exploited––let’s not overstate it, but the freedom of the worker depends upon the subjection of the “non-worker,” the racialized other. Whatever benefits the exploited have are somehow off the backs of the expropriated. And of course, the real benefits don’t go to the exploited at all, but to capital. So, I think that race is central. And whenever capitalism takes a form in which it requires––I would say it always requires both expropriation and exploitation––but whenever it takes the form of assigning those two “functions” to two different populations, the result is racialization.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:A particularly interesting history you sketch out, that you touched on a few minutes ago, is how different forms of expropriation, by way of things like colonial plunder and slavery, also relate to specific forms of environmental dispossession. You describe it, I think, as a relationship between free labor and expropriation on the one hand, and fossil fuel energy versus human energy on the other. And I think this brings together two important aspects of your theory. Can you explain that dynamic, and how that plays out, not just between nation states, but within them as well? And that actually might get to your expropriation point that you were just touching on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:That’s a very important question. The idea, if we just start by thinking for a moment about energy and how capitalist production––all production––relies on energy, then…I’m influenced by a really interesting essay that I read by J.R. McNeill, 
who distinguished between somatic and extrasomatic energy regimes. A somatic regime depends upon human and animal bodies to convert, let’s say, solar energy, chemical energy, into mechanical energy and then to use that to labor. So it’s human muscle, and oxen, and horses, and all of that. And for millennia, including in the early stages of capitalism, that’s what powered production. Then you get this very important moment with the introduction, what’s really the invention by Watt, of the steam engine and the idea that you can actually convert chemical to mechanical energy outside of living bodies. You can do it in a machine, in an engine. And this is a total game-changer because it means that you can––well, the appearance is that you liberate yourself from the need for living bodies and from the need for more and more land to feed the living bodies. You can liberate yourself from the need for biomass. Whereas before, if you wanted to scale up production, you had to conquer more bodies, you had to conquer more lands to feed them. Now, apparently, all you need to do is get a little bit of coal and a smaller number of workers, put them inside a factory, and crank up the steam engine. Well, what is clear to me is that that’s only the front story, the tip of the iceberg. You could say that the harshest and most obvious fallout from a couple of centuries of really rampant carbon emissions falls most obviously and harshly on people in the Global South. And, one should add, communities of color within the Global North, who are subject to environmental racism, toxic dumping, and so on and so forth. So this is all entwined, this ecological side of the story and the part of it that has to do with expropriation and imperialism, which again has to do, as you rightly pointed out, with the way that capitalism divides economy from polity. It sets up a world economic system and then superimposes on that a multi-state political system of vastly unequal states, it must be added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:The front story of the future, I think, is Elon Musk, it’s self-driving cars, it’s high-frequency trading, it’s seamless and near-total automation, it’s technological fixes to the ecological crisis. What do you make of that front story? And what’s the backstory that it’s dependent on but disavowing? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Yeah, that’s the sort of hyper fantasy of freedom from materiality. This is the idea that we somehow catapult ourselves out of embodiment, out of our planetary material existence, and somehow give birth to ourselves as pure mind or symbolic beings or whatever, and get everything that we need or want in that way. But these fantasies of liberation from nature and from labor have always meant one thing. They have always meant offloading the burdens onto other bodies and other natures far away, from which we try to, let’s say, cordon ourselves off in our gated worlds and so on. It makes no sense. It’s only possible, like Manchester, because there’s Mississippi somewhere else. And that means other people, whose conditions of life are being devastated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Another question about this division between politics and economics, which I think is also, as an aside, something that helps me understand how libertarians get away with cleansing the market of power relations of domination. But it’s a division, like the others you outline obviously, that mystifies these deep and mutually dependent relationships, and today that seems really clear on a lot of different fronts. You have the Tea Party and then Trump and the way that freedom of movement for capital has been met with this increasing nationalism, hardening of borders, xenophobia. Obviously, no crisis predictably or automatically determines any particular political outcome. But, on a theoretical level, I’d like you to explain the difference between objective and subjective crises. And, more concretely, to explain the current dynamic between economic and political crises that we’re witnessing with what seems to be a legitimation crisis for the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Yeah, that’s a very important point. We’ve been talking so far without really making a distinction between an objective aspect of a crisis and a lived, or social, or subjective, aspect of a crisis. But when we were talking about this dynamic, whereby capital is always trying to confiscate as much as it can in the way of free labor, free nature, free political benefits, without paying their costs, that’s an objective system dynamic, and one that, I was trying to suggest, is––without some kind of intervention, left to its own devices––one that will necessarily end up undermining, destabilizing, exhausting, the very background conditions that the system needs. That would be an objective story about a crisis tendency. It’s kind of parallel to what Marx meant by the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. That’s an objective dynamic. On the other hand, when we talked about class struggles and boundary struggles and all of that, we’re talking about how people react to the playing out of the objective tendencies, how they respond. Do they register that there’s something really negative going on or not? Do they actually think it’s a crisis or not? And what it means to think it’s a crisis is to think, “This is not accidental that these bad things are going on, but there’s something about the system itself that is generating them.” And that this system could be changed. And that we stand at a crossroads and might be willing to undertake the responsibility to organize collectively to change them. That’s all part of what it means to react subjectively and to assume the burden of calling something a crisis and responding to it in that way. And I would say that today, that the present form of capitalism––you can call it neoliberal globalizing financialized capitalism––has brought us, in a very acute way, to an objective crisis. We have all kinds of indicators of that, even including the decline of life expectancy for important segments of the population in the United States. So, there’s definitely an objective crisis going on. And it is more and more being registered by people as such. However, that’s when the fun begins, if you like. Because everything depends on how people who register a crisis interpret it, where they think its true sources are, who’s the culprit, what’s to blame, what needs to be changed, etc. And at any moment, historically, there is more than one such story around. In fact, a crisis, you mentioned a legitimation crisis, what that means is that the established narratives through which people interpreted what was going on in, let’s say, a “normal” non-crisis period, have lost their credibility. So you could say there’s a breakdown of hegemony, of the dominant narratives and meanings and schemas that people used to interpret. And when that happens, you get a rush of alternative schemas, narratives, stories, that flood into the public sphere and you get, what can be, a wild competition among them to establish a counter hegemony, another dominant narrative. I think that’s exactly what’s going on today…the flood of new people into Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party in Britain, the success of Podemos in Spain, and on, and on, and on. These are counter attempts to get in there with an alternative narrative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And we have Ocasio-Cortez and Cynthia Nixon’s challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:There’s definitely a countervailing energy that began––we could look at antecedents going back to the anti-WTO protest era to Occupy and Black Lives Matter––but then through Bernie Sanders and really the way Bernie Sanders, that energy, reacts to Trump’s election and the way Trump’s election really more totally delegitimates a Clintonian version of what you call progressive neoliberalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Yeah, I think to understand this we do really have to talk about what I call progressive neoliberalism. And I mean the failure, which is so apparent today. So there’s a veneer of progressive and seemingly egalitarian emancipatory aspirations that got tied up––and I do think Bill Clinton is the key architect of all this with the so-called New Democrats––it got all tied up with a political economy that created NAFTA, the WTO, repealed Glass-Steagall, all the ways in which it basically invited industry to decamp and finance, to metastasize. So obviously that political economy, which we’ve had 30 some years of, has really clobbered the U.S. working class. And when I say working class, I mean that in the broadest sense. I don’t just mean construction workers, factory workers, miners and drillers. I mean the whole working class, which includes, obviously, people of color and women and immigrants. So the working class and many parts of what people who would call themselves middle class have been clobbered by this political economy. An important segment of them––this was Trump’s genius, but he didn’t invent it––an important segment of them associate that political economy with feminism, multiculturalism, coddling Blacks and immigrants. And it’s not crazy because those social movements––or again, as I say, the mainstream conventional segments––were allied with those governments and with those corporate forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Your argument on this point, near the end of the book, is really interesting. You write that this prior hegemonic political order was this divide between progressive and reactionary neoliberalism. That dynamic, as we’ve discussed, exploded in part due to these left and right populist challenges from Sanders and Trump. But since taking office, obviously, Trump has, in so many ways, doubled down on neoliberalism. His biggest legislative accomplishment to date is just the most standard Reaganite Republican tax cut imaginable. And your argument is that as a result of that, maybe, he has doubled down on his reactionary social politics and xenophobia. And I think that’s a really compelling argument, especially seeing his behavior in the lead-up to the midterm. But the analysis of yours I find even more interesting, and that I hadn’t quite thought of as such before is that, ironically, the liberal/neoliberal resistance figures and Trump are, in some ways, involved in the same quixotic effort, which is to reinstate this already destroyed hegemonic political order that just divides, which makes either progressive or reactionary neoliberalism the only choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Yeah, that’s exactly right. I do think prior to the Sanders-Trump moment we had a situation in which we had two choices: a reactionary neoliberalism or a progressive neoliberalism. Granted, you could choose between ethnonationalism and multiculturalism, but you were going to be stuck, either way, with financialization and deindustrialization. So that was the limited choice. And then we had this astonishing moment when these two figures––and I don’t mean to suggest that there wasn’t plenty going on before that led up to this and enabled it, and you rightly mentioned Occupy and Black Lives Matter and so on. Fair enough, but nevertheless there’s this moment where, suddenly, the political universe widens and there are some other options. And yes, I did call them a progressive populism on the Sanders side versus a reactionary populism on the Trump side. Now, Trump in power is another story, the old bait-and-switch. The economic side of the populism goes, as you say, and he doubles down. So I said what he really gives us is hyper-reactionary neoliberalism. And you’re right, the so-called resistance, as you pointed out already––I mean there is a big battle going on between a Clintonite wing and what you could call a Sanders wing for what this resistance is going to look like. And I would say that the Clintonite wing, its aim, I think, is to restore the status quo ante, meaning to reinstate progressive neoliberalism. That, to me, is such a devastatingly bad idea. All that does is recreate the conditions that created Trump and prepares the way for future Trumps, even more horrible Trumps. And believe me, there can be more horrible Trumps than this one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:It’s a devastatingly bad idea, but it’s also a very predictable one, because in a legitimation crisis it’s no surprise that the actors in the discredited order have no tools but the ones that used to work to resort to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:You know, there’s a tendency in situations like this for people to feel they need to close ranks and fight the fascist menace. Well, we should first of all talk about whether fascism is even the right word. I doubt that it is. But in any case, we’re not at a point where closing ranks is the only sane thing to do. I mean moments do come up in history where you have to do that. This is not one, or at least not yet. And I think it is a moment for a left and progressive populism or democratic socialism––there are many terms one could use here––to really jump into the breach in a big way and try not to close ranks, but to promote divisions, to try to split off the mass of people who identify with feminism, anti-racism, environmentalism, multiculturalism. plit them off from their neoliberal allies, from the Hillary Clintons and others, who have ventriloquized their demands and claims in a form that is perfectly consistent with neoliberal financialization. Let’s try to create a split. Let’s be done with “lean in” feminism, with corporate feminism. I’m part of an initiative of feminists and socialist feminists who have tried to start something we call “the feminism for the 99 percent.” And I’d like to see an environmentalism for the 99 percent, and an anti-racism for the 99 percent, and on, and on. The point is: we should split the progressive ranks and, at the same time, try to split Trump’s ranks. Because I am convinced that a lot of the working-class people who voted for him, I mean white working-class people in the upper Midwest and elsewhere, are not forever wedded to this xenophobic, anti-immigrant, ethno-national, and racist perspective. The proof is that we know that 8.5 million of them voted Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. That shows, right off the bat, that they’re not card-carrying racists. They voted Sanders, many of them, in the Democratic primary. They’re opportunistic. They’re voting for whoever talks a good line on the economy, on jobs, on wages, and on public services. And Trump did talk a better line on some of those things than Hillary Clinton did, but we can talk an even better line on those things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:And one that’s not racist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF: 
And we can link it to the progressive views about gender, race, immigration and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:I want to ask you about how alienation fits into all of this, because it seems like it’s a key to getting beyond narrowly economistic analysis and lead us to an analysis that can help us understand things like the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory or the really lethal disaffection amongst white workers, in terms of the deaths of despair from suicide and opioids, who, in many cases, are still much better off than their counterparts of color. You write that, “Markets in labor power change the internal character of what is traded on them and the surrounding form of life in which they are located.” What is alienation? Does it take place in multiple ways and on multiple levels, say at both the point of production and also in a larger systemic manner? And what is it that we’re alienated from or made alien to? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Right. Look, this is a complicated philosophical question as well as a political and interpretive question. There’s a long tradition, that goes back to Marx’s very early writings, to write about alienated labor, meaning exploited wage labor within capitalism where the worker is alienated from her or his own self, his own laboring activity, which he or she doesn’t control, is controlled by the capitalists, alienated from the product of the labor, alienated from fellow human beings, and from what Marx famously called the worker’s “species-being,” our humanity as such. By which I think he meant our freedom to collectively decide what kind of life, form of life, we want to live, and to build the institutions and so on in order to do that. And we’re, I would say, people today are alienated from all of those things. I mean there’s nothing more alienated, in terms of labor, than having to follow some script in interacting with customers, either on the phone or at a fast food joint, while you’re also doing some backbreaking and repetitive labor in hot and horrible conditions. So we’re no strangers to alienated labor. Even, I mean I think the popularity of freelancing and all of this, even though that’s quite mystified in certain ways it does bespeak a hunger for creativity, being able to determine  how you use your time, being an individual, not just being under the watchful surveillance of somebody else’s script. All of that is important, but I would say the deepest meaning of alienation and being unalienated has to do with freedom and democracy. Meaning capitalism basically steals from us, not just our labor and energy, but our ability to decide collectively the most important questions about how we want to live. How hard do we want to work? How many hours? How much leisure do we want to have? What do we want to leave for future generations? How do we want to relate to non-human nature? What should we do with the social surplus that we collectively produce? These are the fundamental questions about the shape of our lives. And they are decided now, essentially, by a small handful of people who appropriate the surplus we produce and basically use market mechanisms to invest it for the sake of maximal expansion on and on, and on and on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:In other words, we live in a society where Elon Musk gets to decide that he is firing a car into space for fun, and that’s how our social wealth is being used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF:Exactly. Absolutely. Whereas there might be many many other things that we would prefer to do with that wealth. We might even prefer to produce less wealth and to live more simply and companionably, and socially, and easily, in a more relaxed way. Absolutely. So the freedom that people speak about in liberal democracy that we have is so poor, it’s so limited, it’s so paltry. And this is even apart from the compromise of voting registration and money in politics. Just the way the agenda is defined to exclude all the most fundamental questions, to let Elon Musk decide them. It’s such a poor and paltry thing and we could have such a freer and more democratic life, but that’s not compatible with capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD:Two other things that I want to discuss with regard to social reproduction: first, the politics of immigration. As anthropologist Leo Chavez, and I’m sure many others as well, have suggested, it’s something that’s very much enmeshed in questions of social reproduction. On the one hand, there’s the notion that Latinos and Latinas, in particular, because of higher birthrates, pose a demographic threat. Representative Steve King, who’s this leading nativist Republican from Iowa, infamously tweeted, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” It was obscene but quite exemplary, I think. And then on the other hand, you also see this in immigration enforcement with the recent policy of family separation. Could you talk a little bit about nativism as a social reproduction––nativism, xenophobia, racism––as a social reproduction crisis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF: 
It’s such an interesting question. And there are so many complexities because, historically, when the ideas about reproduction have been racialized what people want to produce is, let’s say, a pure white race of people etc. But they, periodically, have always needed people of color to do the grunt work for that. I mean that’s what slavery is all about, for example, to do the grunt work of caring for the babies, of cooking the food, and all of that so-called house slave labor, as well as the food production and other forms of production. So it’s, I think, another example…I mean, you actually don’t really find people who are consistently segregationist in this sense, and who don’t still want to freeload and free ride off of people of color. So they’re in a certain kind of performative contradiction themselves. And the other really interesting thing, which I think creates a real dilemma for the left, it is, above all, global corporate capital that wants more immigration. They want workers. And it has historically, by and large, been organized labor that has wanted more restrictive immigration. That sort of turns the––our hope for ideas about class struggle on their head. There really is, one would have to distinguish between aspects of the situation in which immigration might really hurt existing workers, and I don’t think that’s the case much in the United States today, and cases where it’s a pure phantasm with no real objective basis. And the problem is that we don’t have a global labor regime with global labor rights, global labor protections, global labor entitlements, so that there is an unevenness in how workers can be treated and paid throughout the world. Capital loves that and takes advantage of it. Organized labor rightly objects, but is so weak in the United States today–– &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD: 
But objects to the individuals, rather than the structure, rather than the segmented market in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF: 
Right, exactly. It just hunkers down to protect a small and dwindling existing membership against the “other,” which is exactly, again, the wrong way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD: 
Well, Nancy Fraser, thank you so much for your time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NF: 
You’re very welcome. It’s been a really interesting conversation, and I thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legendary critical theorist Nancy Fraser argues that a total analysis of capitalism requires taking Marxism beyond a narrowly economistic view. Throughout its history, capitalism has been defined not just by labor exploitation but also by the disavowal of that exploitation’s own basic conditions of possibility: the things that the daily business of labor exploitation and surplus value appropriation require from politics, care work, war-making, mining, patriarchy, racism and more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan speaks to Elizabeth Rush, the author of 
, a lyrical, mournful but ultimately hopeful account of people dealing with amongst the most tangible effects of global warming right now: the rising seas that are threatening poor and working-class people with dislocation, community destruction and compounded destitution. It’s a beautifully-written guide to the current crisis that sugarcoats nothing yet that highlights how ordinary people can organize to fight for their future and that of the planet where we live.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Eco-Socialism and the Climate Crisis</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/eco-socialism-and-the-climate-crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s episode is a long one. It’s the first of two this week on climate politics: a live event that I hosted at Verso Books in New York a couple weeks ago. Or, at least part of it is. The event livestream, which we grabbed the audio from, malfunctioned for the first half hour or so of the episode. And so, dear listeners, we made lemonade out of audiovisual lemons and re-did the first part of the interview later over the phone from Providence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan spoke to Audrea Lim, Thea Riofrancos, Ashley Dawson and Daniel Aldana Cohen about how the left should respond to the climate crisis—and how that response, for better or for worse, will require a deep transformation in social and economic relations, and also in our built environment and how we inhabit it. In other words, eco-socialism is the only solution because we can’t achieve real ecological balance without socialism, and true socialism that delivers liberation would be concretely impossible without ecological balance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Russia: the more your average American thinks about it, the less they seem to know. National security-state enthused liberals blame Putin and for creating what is an obviously-if-incomprehensibly made-in-America monster. Trump, in turn, cannot seem to contain his giddy enthusiasm for Putin’s brand of hyper-masculine authoritarianism. Meanwhile, Russia, an actual country where roughly 144 million people live, has become mostly invisible to Americans—because it has been replaced by a caricature. Sean Guillory, the host of the SRB podcast and author of seansrussiablog.org, explains it all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/asli-bali-on-syria-part-ii</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part two of a two-part interview with Aslı Bâli on the Syrian civil war and the larger geopolitical conflicts that shape the Middle East—with an emphasis on the role played the United States. During part one, which you should definitely listen to first, Bâli discussed the various powers sacrificing the lives of Syrian people in the pursuit of their perceived geopolitical and sectarian interests. In this installment, Bâli discusses the restrictive frames that dominates the American discussion over Syria, and then assesses the lack of a coherent heterodox left-wing foreign policy in the United States—something that we desperately need as the possibility of the left taking power becomes newly plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

Syrians continue to suffer and to die while various actors treat the conflict as a proxy for their own geopolitical ends; meanwhile, huge numbers of Syrian refugees languish in neighboring countries, and the much smaller number who have made their way to Europe and the United States have been utilized by a resurgent far-right to blame ordinary Syrians for violence rooted in the colonial operations of those very same countries that now insist on keeping the refugees out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That right-wing people in the US and Europe have made George Soros the answer to so many troubling questions is not very surprising: he’s a billionaire, he’s Jewish and, unlike most of his cohort, he is an actual intellectual who spends much of his money on substantively progressive causes. Daniel Bessner’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-globalist/&quot;&gt;essay on him in n+1&lt;/a&gt;, however, not only sketches out the right’s obsessions but also offers a detailed analysis of Soros as a thinker and philanthropist—coming to the conclusion that Soros’ hope for an open and pluralistic society will be forever doomed if we continue to live under the very capitalist system that made him so spectacularly rich.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry to Bother You is a hilarious film about the dead serious shitiness of life under neoliberalism’s flexibilized and precarious labor regime, a system teetering upon a thin line between free labor exploitation and a form of expropriation reminiscent of full-on slave labor—all at the mercy of the thinly-veiled barbarity of Palo Alto-style techno-utopianism. It’s about how capitalist society divides and conquers friends and family to claim not only our obedience but also our very souls, and about how the task of left organizing is to see through that game and fight together. Dan’s guest today is Boots Riley, who wrote and directed the film and also fronts the left-wing hip hop group The Coup.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The SESTA/FOSTA law purportedly aims to curb sex trafficking. But as my guest Melissa Gira Grant explains, it actually denies sex workers access to online platforms to more safely conduct their business. It received just two “no” votes in the Senate: from Rand Paul and Ron Wyden. It’s a problem of hegemony: prohibition has long been plain common sense. So, it’s our job to change that. The first step is to make it clear that there is dissent, and that prohibition is self-evidently neither good policy nor good politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d be hard-pressed to find an American elected official as clear about connecting the domestic and foreign politics of US empire as Kaniela Ing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ing is a State Representative of Hawaii and member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) running for Congress in his state’s first congressional district. Calling for an end to imperialism, as well as rule by the wealthy, strengthened housing rights, a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and free college, Ing centers how the violence the United States carries out overseas produces oppression at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ing is backed by Justice Democrats. And like Ocasio-Cortez, Ing has released a powerful ad tying all his campaign’s themes together, made by the filmmakers at Means of Production. You can watch that video here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Denvir interviewed Ing about his campaign for The Dig, Denvir’s podcast on Jacobin Radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaniela Ing (kanielaing.com) is a DSA member running in Hawaii’s 1st Congressional District, calling for an end to imperialism and rule by the wealthy, and for housing rights, a green New Deal, Medicare for All, and free college. And he’s Dan’s guest. Ocasio-Cortez became an overnight celebrity when she defeated Joe Crowely. But what’s most important is that you know who these candidates are before election day—because that’s when they most need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Janus was an entirely expected and atrocious decision. The conservative business interests that successfully obliterated private sector unions hope it will do the same to their public-sector counterparts. Chris Maisano, a contributing editor at Jacobin, argues that labor has no choice but to return to its militant roots if it hopes to survive. In other words, to survive, labor has to fight for a lot more than mere survival.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Checking your privilege. Invisible knapsacks. Intersectionality. In his new book from Verso, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2716-mistaken-identity&quot;&gt;Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump&lt;/a&gt;, Asad Haider questions the terms and concepts that underpin much liberal and left conversation about race and racism, exploring critiques advanced by the black radical tradition to mount a thoroughgoing demolition of what we now refer to as “identity politics”—something that had a quite different meaning when it was first coined by the black, radical lesbian feminists of the Combahee River Collective. This is not a book that dismisses racism and sexism. Quite to the contrary. Haider shows that we can only confront and defeat oppressions like racism and sexism if we recognize their relationship to the capitalist exploitation of the working class as a whole. The corollary is also true: capitalism can never be defeated without recognizing and fighting the various oppressions that help sustain it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2018-07-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;American leftists are stuck in a conundrum. On the one hand, our two major parties are dominated by corporate interests — including the Democrats, who are currently tasked with (and failing to) meet the challenge of opposing the openly reactionary and wealth-worshipping Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other, our country’s laws governing third parties are the most restrictive of any established democracy, making ballot-line challenges to the two major, corporate-dominated parties arduous, if not impossible. We seem doomed to either quixotic, ineffectual third-party challenges, or getting sucked into the conservatizing force field of the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 article, Jacobin executive editor Seth Ackerman proposed another way. He argued for creating an independent organization that functions in key ways like parties in other countries around the world, with an official membership, a binding platform, and clear mechanisms to ensure fealty to that platform from candidates and officeholders running under the organization’s banner — all things the Democratic Party currently lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of whether to run on the Democratic ballot line or something else, he argued, should be secondary: left candidates should run as independents when it makes sense to and Democrats when it doesn’t. But our principal concern should be creating that party-like organization — not what’s listed on a ballot line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of successful challenges to the Democratic Party leadership by insurgent candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the explosion in membership of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Daniel Denvir of Jacobin’s The Dig podcast spoke with Ackerman about the ideas in that article and the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last episode in this week’s Ocasio-Cortez super series. First, an interview with Seth Ackerman on his essay “A Blueprint for a New Party,” which lays out a strategy for building independent socialist power effectively, which means opportunistically seizing the Democratic Party ballot line when necessary. jacobinmag.com/2016/11/bernie-sanders-democratic-labor-party-ackerman/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Kate Aronoff on her article “A Revolution From Within,” which explains Our Revolution and Justice Democrats, two organizations formed out of the Bernie campaign that are playing critical roles in the left electoral insurgency. dissentmagazine.org/article/transforming-electoral-process-our-revolution-justice-democrats&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week’s super series on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s victory and the future of left politics continues with Julia Salazar, a DSA member running for a Brooklyn state Senate in New York’s District 18. Salazar’s campaign worked hard for Ocasio-Cortez; now, Ocasio-Cortez’s team is returning the favor. Recently, The New York Daily News wondered if Salazar might be the new Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez responded: Salazar “isn’t the next me, she’s the first HER.” Indeed, Salazar has her own story to tell. She immigrated from Colombia as a child, and came of age as a young activist by organizing a rent strike in her Harlem building. She describes herself as a democratic socialist, which she defines as recognizing “the capitalist system as being inherently oppressive and actively working to dismantle it and to empower the working class and the marginalized in our society.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Transcript: Bernie Sanders on Ocasio-Cortez: We're seeing it all over this country</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of several recent successful challenges from the left to centrist, “establishment” Democrats, most notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders isn’t on record telling anyone “I told you so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Sanders has long argued that “better than the Republicans” isn’t enough for Democrats (or anyone else) to win elections — a bold political vision is needed to excite voters enough to turn out for candidates. We can’t know what will happen with progressive challengers like Ocasio-Cortez and Maryland gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous if and when they take office. But their campaigns seem to vindicate Sanders’s basic argument about the appeal of unapologetic, “anti-establishment” politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview with Daniel Denvir for Jacobin Radio’s The Dig podcast, Sanders discusses Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other recent shakeups within the Democratic Party, and why a bold political vision is good politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitol Hill used to be a lonely place for a leftist. And, frankly, it still is. But now that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appears to be headed to Washington, Senator Bernie Sanders will likely have some powerful company. Today, Sanders is Dan’s guest, and they’re talking about the impact of Ocasio-Cortez’s victory and where the left goes from here. This is the latest interview in this week’s Ocasio-Cortez super series, which has already included interviews with Ocasio-Cortez and Cynthia Nixon. Next up is DSA member Julia Salazar, who is running for state senate in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Transcript: Cynthia Nixon on Challenging Cuomo in Wake of Ocasio-Cortez Win</title>

&lt;p&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s victory should make New York governor Andrew Cuomo very afraid. He faces a challenge from Cynthia Nixon, who has spent the years since her time on Sex and the City organizing for public education — and, just after the interview below was conducted, came out as a democratic socialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nixon’s campaign against Cuomo once appeared to be a long-shot attack on the king of New York politics, but it increasingly appears to actually have a chance. At the very least, it’s led to some mind-boggling shifts in politics, like a recent article in Politico covering the deliberations of the New York Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) over whether to endorse her. Who would’ve thought they would live to see a socialist group’s internal discussions become fodder for beltway outlets’ horse race coverage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nixon spoke this week to Daniel Denvir for Jacobin Radio’s The Dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s victory should make New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a larger-than-life bully and ideologically-chameleon Democrat, very afraid. He faces a challenge from Dan’s guest today, Cynthia Nixon, who has spent the years after her time on Sex in the City organizing for public education. After what happened to Joe Crowley, the left is more energized than ever. And what once appeared to be a long-shot attack on the king of New York politics now appears like it might just hit its target. This is the second episode in this week’s super series on left electoral politics in the wake of Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a little while to nail down Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for an interview, because she’s been a little busy over the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a primary victory in New York’s fourteenth district that nearly no one saw coming, Ocasio-Cortez defeated ten-term incumbent and Democratic Party power player Joe Crowley. A twenty-eight-year-old member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) who was working as a bartender last year unseated a potential Democratic House speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Denvir spoke with Ocasio-Cortez this week for his Jacobin Radio podcast The Dig, covering the nuts and bolts of her campaign, why centrist Democrats throughout the country are vulnerable to left-wing challengers, the necessity of candidates putting forward a bold political vision, voter disenfranchisement, the political status of Puerto Rico, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a 28-year old Latina working-class champion committed to social transformation who beat one of the most powerful men in Congress: the King of Queens. Dan had an extended conversation with her about how organized people won her election, how she’ll stay accountable to those movements now that she’s a rock star, establishment myopia and denial, The Congressional Progressive Caucus’ shortcomings, and where the insurgency goes from here. Then Intercept D.C. Bureau Chief Ryan Grim on left media and left electoral politics, why mainstream media missed Ocasio-Cortez, and why Emily’s List fails to support left women challengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace has broken out across the Korean Peninsula—or, at least, the odds that Donald Trump will blow the world up have gone down a just a bit—at least temporarily. Yes, Trump is the one who pushed us way too close to the brink of nuclear war. And yes, he likely sought peace with Kim Jong-Un because he loves wins, whatever their political or ideological content. But wow, has the liberal reaction been revealing. According to the mindset that pervades the liberal media and political elite, a move toward peace with North Korea is bad because Trump is bad. Or perhaps worse yet, it’s bad because the national security state conventional wisdom that has governed Washington under both parties for so long—purveyed by the very people who have brought us endless war almost everywhere—says that it’s bad. It’s clearer than ever that the task of the left to find a way out of this ideological closed circuit of the liberal vs. Trump foreign policy debate—and, if we win power, to shut down its warmongering for good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Transcript: David Harvey on Capital</title>

&lt;p&gt;It’s been more than a century and a half since Karl Marx published the first volume of Capital. It’s a massive, intimidating tome — one that many readers might be tempted to skip. Radical scholar David Harvey doesn’t think you should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey has taught Capital for decades. His popular courses on the book’s three volumes are available for free online and have been watched by millions around the world; they were the basis for his companion books to volumes one and two. Harvey’s latest book, Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason is a shorter companion to all three volumes. In it, he deals with the fundamental irrationality of a capitalist system whose functioning is supposed to be anything but.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey spoke with Daniel Denvir for Jacobin Radio’s podcast The Dig, about the book, capital’s simultaneous creative and destructive forces, climate change, and why Capital is still worth wrestling with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Harvey has taught Capital to huge numbers of people everywhere. Dan interviews him about his latest book, Marx, Capital and the Madness of Economic Reason. Harvey explains why he thinks all three volumes are of Capital are key, why we’re still living under neoliberalism at least unless and until ethnonationalist autarchy pushes it aside, how capitalism might survive climate change via mass immiseration, and linking struggles over production and consumption in the fight to transform society toward socialism. And more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he US colony of Puerto Rico has suffered a series of shocks in recent years. In 2006, tax breaks intended to lure manufacturers to the island expired, prompting widespread capital flight. Then, the financial crisis hit, and the island’s government borrowed huge sums of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting debt crisis was followed by widespread public sector layoffs. Since then, the federal PROMESA law created an unelected financial oversight and management board, or Junta, which has moved to impose yet more austerity on the island. And that was before Hurricane Maria hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than three hundred schools have already been closed and huge numbers have left the island. Puerto Ricans are profoundly traumatized — which is precisely what successful shock doctrines depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Naomi Klein’s new book 
The Battle for Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes On the Disaster Capitalists is all about. Daniel Denvir recently spoke with Klein and Mercedes Martinez, the president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US colony of Puerto Rico has been repeatedly shocked and Puerto Ricans are traumatized. That is precisely what successful shock doctrines like this one—which wants to remake the island into a utopia for rich Americans and crypto-bros and a dystopia for everyone else—depend upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is is the subject of Naomi Klein’s new book from Haymarket, The Battle For Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes on the Disaster Capitalists. Today, Klein returns to The Dig, and is joined by Mercedes Martínez, president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spain Part II: Rajoy Falls</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/spain-part-ii-rajoy-falls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we posted an interview Dan recorded in Barcelona on Spanish politics—specifically the question of Catalan independence, and also the municipalist movement governing cities like Barcelona. What we didn’t really talk much about was the fact that the conservative Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy was about to fall—which it did, just a few days later. So, Dan brought sociologist Carlos Delclós back for a follow-up interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production note: Dan sounds like he’s speaking in an aquarium or calling into his own show because he fucked up the recording. So don’t blame Alex Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Democracy in Chains with Nancy MacLean</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For libertarians, liberty means something different. It’s about liberty for property owners. And in their quest to preserve that absolute freedom for the ownership class—whether their assets be human slaves, factories or extractive industries—democracy must be curtailed and the power of the people must be checked and repressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the argument put forward by Dan’s guest, historian Nancy MacLean, in her book Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right’s Stealth Plan for America. The book makes a powerful argument for the anti-democratic origins and trajectory of free-market fundamentalist Koch-Brothers-aligned economists who have come to profoundly shape and warp American politics to fit their dystopian vision. The book has also been controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2018-06-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/two-societies-one-black-one-white-separate-and-unequal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, a mainstream group of high-profile Americans declared the following: “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal. Reaction to last summer’s disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division. Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life; they now threaten the future of every American. This deepening racial division is not inevitable. The movement apart can be reversed. Choice is still possible. Our principal task is to define that choice and to press for a national resolution.” The Kerner Commission, established by President Johnson, embodied left liberalism at its most bold and idealistic. But that vision of radical reform was eviscerated by the American war on Vietnam, the rise of neoliberalism and the modern conservative movement, and liberal triangulation that reached its apotheosis under Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan talks to Vanessa A. Bee, a consumer protection lawyer in D.C. and a social media editor for Current Affairs magazine, about her New York magazine essay on the subject nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/how-we-can-get-a-more-equal-union.html&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A laundry list of modest policy solutions is not enough, it turns out. It’s not just that technocratic fixes-around-the-edges spectacularly fail to meet people’s needs; in failing to articulate a big picture vision of how the world ought to be transformed, they fail to move people—either emotionally or, more concretely, to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan’s guest George Monbiot argues that the left needs a powerful new story to win power and change lives in his new book, Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread.” The rule of law: the #resistance has construed it to be a cornerstone of opposition to Trump. It is certainly alarming to live under a president who flirts with operating in a permanent and near-total state of exception. But it’s the rule of law as we’ve known it that has blessed the wide-open floodgates of corporate money into American politics, looked the other way in the face of unchecked national security state abuses, christened separate and unequal schools and, of course, rubber-stamped the rise of mass incarceration. The law has no transcendent moral basis. Rather, it is shaped by political-economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan’s guest is Amy Kapczynski, professor of law at Yale Law School, and a co-convenor of LPEblog.org.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan just moderated a discussion in Philadelphia with Senator Sanders, along with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, scholar and frequent Dig guest Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor and veteran defense lawyer and advocate Premal Dharia. Bernie came to Philly because what’s happening here is extraordinarily important: it’s a city where for years cops have committed abuses and engaged in corruption with near impunity, and where prosecutors long looked the other way while feeding poor young black and brown men into the present-day peculiar institution of mass incarceration. Last year, Philadelphia elected Krasner, a long-time civil rights champion who pledged to fight the to end mass incarceration, as its district attorney. And that happened for the same reason that Bernie came out of nowhere and nearly ran away with the Democratic nomination in 2016: their message tapped into and was lifted up by massive grassroots movements, representing and speaking to an emerging majority that wants transformative change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so this is why Bernie Sanders came to Philly: to learn about what has gone so horribly wrong with the criminal justice system and how we can all organize and do the hard work to make it right.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part two of Dan’s interview on Hannah Arendt’s notion of “the right to have rights.” This episode covers a lot, including why we must fight not only to expand the democratic political community but also to deepen its power—all at a time when the nativist right is exploiting the many crises unleashed by neoliberalism and empire to erect walls and punish scapegoats. One upshot is that zombie liberalism can’t be the answer, because it is precisely the liberal order that is a key source of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan’s guests today, Stephanie DeGooyer and Astra Taylor, just wrote a book about this for Verso, called the The Right to Have Rights. This is part 2. It’s strongly suggested that you listen to part 1 first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/the-right-to-have-rights-part-i</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What are rights worth when government denies people the very right to have rights? Political theorist Hannah Arendt recognized this loss of “the right to have rights” as millions of refugees found themselves without a national home in the wake of world wars. Human rights, it became clear, proved to be an empty promise for those excluded from citizenship—the foundational right to be a member of a political community. Today, this insight remains a critical one as a record number of humans transit the globe in search of economic and physical security, and far-right nativists and establishment liberals alike scapegoat them for the chaos and precarity unleashed by neoliberalism and war. As a result, migrants are condemned to second-class citizenship or even death in the Mediterranean and desert Mexican-American borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guests today, Stephanie DeGooyer and Astra Taylor, just wrote a book about this for Verso, called the The Right to Have Rights. This is part 1. Part 2 will be posted on Thursday or Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;James Comey is liberal America’s favorite cop and now, as a result, a bestselling author as well. Patrick Blanchfield returns to talk about his Baffler review of Comey’s new book. It’s awful, of course. But it’s bad in productively revealing ways. Comey has become an icon of the liberal fetishization of the national security state as a bulwark against Trumpism—when it fact it is that very national security state and its rampant abuses that are deeply implicated in Trump’s rise. The elevation of police as a model of duty and leadership contrasted against Trump’s vulgar monstrosities renders invisible not only why Trump won but why he is so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s yet the latest installment in our ongoing series on the left and electoral politics. Dan’s guest is Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi. Last year, Mayor Lumumba pledged to make Jackson “the most radical city on the planet.” Lumumba, who comes out of a decades-old revolutionary black nationalist movement, is serious about that. But he also faces serious challenges: Jackson is a majority black city which, like many such cities, has much of its wealth appropriated by its largely-white suburbs. The human and infrastructural needs are enormous, and the tax base is thin. This is precisely why so many on the left have found what’s going on in Jackson to be so interesting, and why Dan was eager to invite the mayor onto the show.&lt;/p&gt;

Cynthia Nixon, running with Working Families Party backing, has Cuomo truly freaked out in New York. There are major primary fights underway in California—most everywhere, it seems, some variant of the left is on the move. But does the fact that a onetime business-aligned Democrat like Gavin Newsom is getting away with posing as the progressive in the California race for governor indicate that the left hasn’t yet built the institutional capacity to control the leftward surge amongst voters? Dan thinks so. These are amongst the topics that he discusses with Dave Weigel, a political reporter at the Washington Post and one of the few mainstream political reporters who really gets the left.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest installment in our ongoing series on the left and electoral politics and we’re talking about Democratic Socialists of America’s new electoral strategy. DSA has almost overnight become a serious force on an American socialist left that has for decades lacked much in the way of serious forces. One of the major reasons the organization’s membership rolls blew up, of course, was because of Bernie Sanders’ historic 2016 run for president, which not only electrified huge swaths of the country but reminded the radical left that the point is to win power and to govern—and that, after years on the margins, we could do so. This was in part because many Americans were no longer afraid of the s-word: socialism. Yet there is still, for many good reasons, a lot of skepticism about electoral politics in general and the Democratic Party very much in particular, inside DSA and across the socialist left. That’s the needle that the new DSA electoral strategy document tries to thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan’s guests are Renée Paradis, a civil rights and criminal defense lawyer (@ReneeParadis). She has frequently worked for electoral campaigns, including most recently as the National Voter Protection Director for Bernie 2016. Michael Kinnucan is a writer, researcher and activist in New York City. You should also follow him on Facebook, where he has a lively and incisive presence. Both are members of DSA’s National Electoral Committee and the organizing committee for NYC-DSA’s Brooklyn Electoral Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/petro-imperialism-with-timothy-mitchell-part-ii</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Historian and political theorist Timothy Mitchell joins Dan for the second of a two-part interview on his book Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil, published in 2011 by Verso. In part 1, we talked about a lot of things, including how the rise of coal made both industrial capitalism and newly powerful worker resistance possible; and how the shift to oil then facilitated the persistence of imperialism in a decolonizing world while thwarting worker organizing. In this installment, we discuss imperialist assaults on worker struggles in Iraq and Iran, the cooptation of those struggles by nationalist elites, and how those imperialist attacks facilitated the rise of the Baathist security state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also look at how the true history of the 70s oil shock undermines the conventional account, how the protection of minorities was used to legitimate imperialism, how petro-dollars fueled the global arms trade, in what sense the Iraq War has been a war for oil, and the US strategy to seek advantage through the continuation of conflict and instability across the Middle East. Finally, we’ll address petro-imperialism’s bedrock alliance with right-wing Islamists against democratic movements of the left in Saudi Arabia and beyond, and why we must fight to ensure that the coming energy transition is a just one.

&lt;p&gt;Historian and political theorist Timothy Mitchell joins Dan for the first of a two-part interview on his book Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil, published in 2011 by Verso. In this first episode, we talk about how the rise of coal made both industrial capitalism and newly powerful worker resistance possible; and how the shift to oil then facilitated the persistence of imperialism in a decolonizing world while thwarting worker organizing. On the next show, we’ll discuss a lot more, including how oil companies and Western governments made autocratic governments and conservative Islamists key partners in creating the very global order that we now find in such profound crisis.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s our 100th episode and the launch of our spring fundraising drive! Aziz Rana returns to The Dig 15 years after the invasion of Iraq to reflect on the paucity of substantive anti-imperialist politics across much of the American left. Socialism isn’t just an internationalist politics on principle: domestic and foreign struggles are inherently linked, just as the forces we struggle against are globally intertwined—and the latter benefit from perpetuating an ideology that artificially divides the two. But for decades, a bipartisan consensus has governed foreign policy, to disastrous ends. Why, Rana asks, is there no foreign policy equivalent to the new left-wing domestic policy litmus test on single-payer healthcare?

But illegality isn’t a property of immigrants; rather, it’s a creation of positive law. And we can only understand how immigrants are declared “illegal” by the government by examining this country’s too-often ignored history of racist and exclusionary immigration politics.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nothing has more defined the monstrosity of Donald Trump than his racist demonization and targeting of immigrants from Mexico, Muslim-majority countries and those nations he deems to be “shitholes” or, according to another account, “shithouses.” But what’s seldom reported is that one of the key mechanisms that the Administration has used to target immigrants was rolled out under Barack Obama. It’s called Secure Communities, and it’s the culmination of decades of policymaking and politicking that have intertwined the United States systems of mass incarceration and immigrant enforcement—facilitating the growth of both.

&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King Jr is often remembered for his soaring oratory. But the commonplace emphasis on his rhetoric rather than his ideas too often allows conservatives to domesticate him, or worse, use his taken-out-of-context words to bolster the very forces of oppression that King struggled to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new book on King’s political philosophy — 
To Shape a New World: Essays on the Political Philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr, co-edited by Brandon M. Terry and Tommie Shelby — takes seriously King as a thinker, not simply an orator or activist. Daniel Denvir, host of Jacobin Radio’s The Dig, recently had the chance to speak with the Harvard scholars about King’s rich political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommie Shelby and Brandon M. Terry talk about their new book To Shape a New World: Essays on the Political Philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr. King is often remembered for his soaring oratory. But the commonplace emphasis on his rhetoric in place of his ideas too often allows enemies of King’s agenda to domesticate him or, worse, to weaponize his taken-out-of-context words to bolster the very forces of racism and oppression that King had struggled to defeat. Dan asks Shelby and Terry about King’s theory of nonviolence (more complicated than you might think), his debate with the Black Power movement, and his thinking on gender, hope, political economy, Beloved Community and more.

&lt;p&gt;Did Russia’s “troll army” steal the 2016 election? Daniel Denvir, host of Jacobin Radio’s The Dig, spoke to the Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald about Russiagate, mass surveillance, and “the resistance” to Donald Trump. The following is a condensed version of their conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Let’s start with the Russian troll army. What did Robert Mueller charge in February of this year, and what do you make of it?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GG:&lt;/strong&gt;
 The most recent indictment charges thirteen Russian nationals, individuals and entities, with two things. One, creating fake identities for social-media usage with the intention of sowing discord in the American political landscape by disseminating inflammatory messages — sometimes supporting Bernie Sanders, sometimes supportive of Donald Trump, sometimes encouraging minorities not to vote, maligning Hillary Clinton, those sorts of things. So fake Facebook identities, fake Twitter identities, designed to make people who are actually Russian appear to be American, communicating to fellow Americans about the election with the intent, according to Mueller, of sowing discord. Secondly, according to Mueller, they organized various political events that were designed to make it look like it was Americans who are orchestrating these events. Some of these events were anti-Hillary, some of them were pro-Trump, but then some of them were anti-Trump, including two that were held once Trump was elected. The big question is: what was the magnitude of this operation? Adrian Chen, who did the earliest work on so-called Russian troll factories, has been very adamant about the limited impact that this kind of activity has because it’s primitive and pales in comparison to the amount of money spent on messaging by political campaigns, let alone US corporations and lobbyists.So there does seem to be a fairly small quantity of disinformation campaigns — sometimes the information was actually accurate in critiquing certain candidates or supporting others. So if you believe the indictment — and of course it hasn’t been yet proven, they’re just allegations by one prosecutor — but if it turns out to be true, it will establish that at least some Russian citizens, whose connection to the Russian government is at best murky and in some cases appears to be nonexistent, engaged in some relatively limited degree of social-media campaigning that was deceitful in its nature because of the identity of who was doing it, and according to Mueller, was designed to create discontent and discord.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What if the Cold War only just ended in November 2016, as Donald Trump grotesquely encircled and then captured the presidency, finding it, to his surprise, unguarded? The Cold War proper, of course, ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Aziz Rana, making his second Dig appearance, argues that it was a lot more than the conflict with the Evil Empire. It was a domestic order that, he writes in the latest issue of 
, “concerned everything from the genius of America’s domestic institutions to the indispensability of its global role. These judgments gave coherence to the country’s national identity—allowing both Barack Obama and Bill Kristol to wax poetic about America’s special destiny as a global hegemon—and legitimacy to its economic policy. But with the 2016 election, the cold-war paradigm finally shattered.” Check out Aziz’s article here https://nplusonemag.com/issue-30/politics/goodbye-cold-war/.

As is often the case, however, the focus shifted elsewhere soon after disturbances in the street came to end. Political scientist @LesterSpence recently wrote an article about why children were freezing in Baltimore public schools: the heating didn’t work, something that can only be made sense of when viewed in the longer history of capital flight, racial and class segregation, and the rise of a service-economy carceral state jacobinmag.com/2018/01/baltimore-freezing-schools-children-racism-austerity Thanks to Verso for their support.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are living on land from which indigenous people, over hundreds of years, were violently removed. On some level, everyone knows this—yet it’s mostly nowhere to be found in stories that Americans tell themselves about who we are as a country, and how we got here. Dan’s guest is Paul Frymer (@pfrymer), a professor of Politics and Director of the Program in Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University. In his recent book, Building an American Empire: The Era of Territorial and Political Expansion, he provides a close study of the empire America built in the late 18th and 19th century, a project of geographic expansion facilitated and also limited by the demands of racial engineering.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees that the 1970s was the beginning of the end of capitalism as we had known it since the New Deal. But historian Lane Windham makes it clear that it wasn’t for a lack of worker struggle in her new book, Knocking on Labor’s Door: Union Organizing in the 1970s and the Roots of a New Economic Divide. In case studies of union fights in department stores, shipyards, offices and textile mills, Windham explains that women and workers of color seized the civil rights victories of the 1960s to fight for economic rights in the 70s.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your first Diglet of the new year, and we’re talking about that Trump book. At n+1 Patrick Blanchfield makes the case that Fire and Fury is not, as some might think, a bunch of meaningless palace-intrigue that has distracted us from what Trump is doing to destroy the environment and wage relentless class war against the poor. Rather, the book in one fell swoop exposes the Trump administration for the dangerously hot mess that we all knew it was but were entirely unable to understand clearly because the deluge of drama and weird tweets had rendered it all banal wallpaper.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chattel slavery made black women’s reproduction the source of private property—and in doing so invented race and American racism. Ever since, the denigration and regulation of black women’s childbearing has been central to the construction of white supremacy and the exploitative economic order that it protects, as scholar Dorothy Roberts explained in Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty, a pivotal book first published in 1997. In this episode, @DorothyERoberts talks about the book and what lessons it holds today as Trump and Republicans seek to destroy yet more of the social safety net and use racism as a smokescreen to distract white Americans from their class war against working people.

Venerating American soldiers, of course, is not about supporting actual American soldiers but is rather a rhetorical device to preclude questioning or criticism of the wars they are sent to fight. In a face-to-face interview at Brown University’s Watson Institute, anthropologist Catherine Lutz discusses John Kelly’s recent diatribe,Khizr Khan, Trump’s attack on protesting NFL players and the roots of it all in the Nixon Administration’s response to GI rebellion against the Vietnam War.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor returns to The Dig to discuss her new book
. Forty years ago, a group of black feminists coined the term “identity politics” in the Combahee River Collective Statement. For them, it was a way to identify the various ways that capitalism, racism, patriarchy, and homophobia created a set of interlocking oppressions. And the point of identifying how those systems operated together was not to create an itemized politics of particularity, as is too often the case today, but rather to create a framework for solidarity.

&lt;p&gt;With a Fox News-animated bigot in the White House and inequality at spectacular heights, discussion of American racism has returned to the center of US politics. The wealth of those categorized as black evaporated under the Obama administration, and today, the Trump administration restricts freedom of movement to scapegoat migrants for economic crisis, while casting white supremacists and those who fight them in the streets as morally equivalent, bestowing Oval Office-granted legitimacy to racist violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a terrifying situation that that has led many to seek out explanations of its historical roots. A recent criticism of Ta-Nehisi Coates by Cornel West became a means to debate not only the origins of racism and class inequality, but also the most effective means of fighting both in the US and globally. In this moment, the US left can advance a deeper and broader conversation about how racism functions in neoliberal, imperial America, and how to build working-class organizations that fight for social justice for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that opportunity requires overcoming a powerful ideological legacy. The dominance of neoliberalism frames inequality as deriving from personal responsibility or the lack thereof and replaces structural analysis with a focus on “race relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possible because of the enshrinement of race as a natural category, the spread of the fiction that certain traits define members of one “race” and differentiate them from members of other races. No one has better diagnosed the problems with this categorization than Barbara and Karen Fields, authors of the 2012 book 
Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life. In an interview that aired on The Dig, Daniel Denvir interviews Barbara and Karen Fields about the police violence, the illusion of race, and how we can fight for working-class liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lengthy interview with historian Barbara Fields and sociologist Karen Fields on their seminal essay collection Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life. Dan talks to the sister scholars about the book; how Ta-Nehisi Coates’ primordialist view of white racism spells defeat; that racism serves the interest of capitalist class war, and endless debates over Rachel Dolezal distract us from that fact; and a whole ton more.

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of nuclear war with North Korea sits near the top of the list of unthinkably bad things about Donald Trump’s presidency. We all worry that a personal slight from Kim Jung Un could prompt Trump to do something horrific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the conflict with North Korea didn’t begin with Trump. It stretches back to World War II, and it includes all sort of US actions that are rarely discussed — from laying waste to North Korea during the Korean War to supporting military despotism in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following interview — which first aired last month on Daniel Denvir’s Jacobin Radio podcast The Dig — veteran journalist Tim Shorrock details this often overlooked history and explains how it shapes the present standoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of nuclear war with North Korea sits near the top of the list of things that have been unthinkably bad about Donald Trump’s presidency. But the conflict with North Korea didn’t begin with Trump. It’s critical that we understand the Koreas and their historical context right now. Journalist @TimothyS breaks it all down—North Korea, South Korea, the role of the US and others—from World War II to the present. And he argues that peace is possible, but it can only achieved through engagement between North and South, not through bellicose US intervention. Thanks to Verso Books for their support.

The demonization of Central American gangs functions to distract the public from US complicity and legitimate a cruel deportation machine.

But last week’s election once again fails to offer any sort of definitive answer to the long-running debate between the left and the corporate Democratic establishment over who is best poised to beat Republicans. The coming anti-Republican wave is an opportunity that the left must seize. Dan’s guests are DSA member Lee Carter, who took out the Republican whip to win Virginia’s 50th House District, and David Duhalde, DSA’s Deputy Director. Thanks to our sponsors at Verso Books.

In reality, settler-colonialism, empire, and a brutally exploitative economic system grounded in racial subjugation have always been at the core of the American project. But radical thinkers and movements have consistently stepped forward at critical junctures to propose transformative alternatives that would make American freedom universal. Rana’s most brilliant move is to ultimately make a devastatingly critical account of American history hopeful and optimistic.Thanks to our supporters at Verso Books.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New Republic reporter Emily Atkin (@emorwee) talks about why Harvey is already and inherently political thanks to climate change and the potential for petrochemical disaster in Houston. When people criticize “politicizing” the disaster they are being political too: it is a naked effort to defend the destructive status quo of fossil-fueled neoliberal capitalism.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hugo Chávez’s rise to power inspired leftists around the world. But today, Venezuela is in a profound economic and political crisis. A huge decline in oil prices gutted the revenue stream that Venezuela depended on to bankroll its social spending. The government led by Chavez’s successor Nicolás Maduro is increasingly turning to repression in response to constant, and often violent, protests from the opposition. NYU historian and NACLA Executive Editor Alejandro Velasco explains what’s happening in Venezuela, how it happened—and how the promise of the Bolivarian Revolution might still be salvaged.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Ecuador, the left won reelection this year, after Alianza PAÍS candidate Lenin Moreno, former President Rafael Correa’s vice president, narrowly won election this year. It was a major victory given the crisis hitting the pink tide of left governments throughout the region. But it was perilously close to a loss. Correa accomplished a lot for the country’s poor majority but did so thanks to a commodity boom that has since gone bust, a strategy that put the left government in conflict with indigenous and environmental movements.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What Trump has accomplished is spread fear through immigrant communities and, with the Muslim and refugee travel bans, made bigotry the explicit cornerstone of immigration policy. But on immigration, as on other matters, Trump does not emerge from a vacuum. Mainstream Democratic and Republican politicians have for decades built a giant deportation machine. Dan talks to Dara Lind, the immigration reporter at Vox and one of the smartest reporters on the beat to put Trump’s deportation campaign and nativist agenda in context.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What’s the matter with Appalachia? Many liberal elites think they know the answer. Since Trump’s campaign first took off, the region has become a symbol of all that is wrong with Red State America: guns, bigotry, a willingness to get swindled by right-wing snake-oil salesmen. There is, indeed, a lot wrong with Appalachia. But what’s most wrong is that a region where people waged militant labor struggles has now been devastated by coal company greed, automation, shifts in global commodity markets and, of course, by Republican reaction and neoliberal malign neglect. Sarah Jones, social media editor at the New Republic, explores the possibilities for left-wing revival in Appalachia.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a moment to read, or to re-read, The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin, Corey Robin’s 2011 collection of essays — especially if you need to disabuse friends and family of the notion that Trump is some historic degradation of conservatism’s good name rather than a malignant, nasty outgrowth of a long history of violent reaction against left movements for equality.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Democratic Socialists of America and the Fight Against Trump</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/the-democratic-socialists-of-america-and-the-fight-against-trump"/>
   <updated>2017-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/the-democratic-socialists-of-america-and-the-fight-against-trump</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Socialists of America are growing — suddenly and explosively. Last June ahead of the Democratic National Convention, DSA counted 6,500 members. Today, after a presidential bid from a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and Trump’s terrifying election, membership has grown to more than 19,000 and counting. People are considering socialism, long a dirty word in American politics, in far larger numbers than in decades past — especially young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, my guests are DSA National Political Committee member Sean Monahan and National Director Maria Svart to discuss some tough questions about the fight for socialism in the coming months and years, both for DSA members (of which, full disclosure, I am one) and those who aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dave Weigel: What the media doesn't get about the left</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the Left, few forms of mainstream journalism are more detested than political reporting. It often substitutes the horse race for substance, dresses up conventional inside-the-Beltway wisdom as real analysis, and resorts to the false balance of he-said-she-said instead of establishing what is actually factual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political reporters took a serious hit after Donald Trump won the Republican primary and then the presidency, and Bernie Sanders mounted a dead serious challenge to the Democratic Party’s anointed candidate. Trump is now using his bully pulpit to wage an assault on empirical reality, clinging to his own “alternative facts” and labeling the media as an opposition party purveying “fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guest today is Dave Weigel, a reporter at the Washington Post who is amongst the best in the game. Weigel has also worked for Slate and, in his early years, at the libertarian outlet Reason. He doesn’t come from the Left, but he gets us better than any mainstream reporter out there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fighting for Black Lives Under Trump&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Movement for Black Lives’ insistence that black lives matter is deceptively straightforward and minimal. But it has transformed black politics, and American politics as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the tension and contradiction of the Obama years, in which a black man became the most powerful person on earth but conditions continued to worsen for black people as a whole, the Movement for Black Lives erupted and made radical demands for social and economic justice, and to an end to police violence and mass incarceration. The movement now has to find a way forward in the time of Trump’s law-and-order backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Marie Gottschalk: Mass incarceration and Trump's carceral state</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/marie-gottschalk-mass-incarceration-and-trumps-carceral-state"/>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/marie-gottschalk-mass-incarceration-and-trumps-carceral-state</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mass incarceration should be central to any analysis of American political economy. It’s also a moral monstrosity. But before The New Jim Crow and anti-mass incarceration activists across the country loudly insisted this was the case, it received little attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie Gottschalk, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, is the author of Caught: The Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics, and The Prison and the Gallows: The Politics of Mass Incarceration in America. She talks with The Dig about prisons in American life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jed Purdy: The courts, Trump and politics in the context of ecological crisis</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/jed-purdy-the-courts-trump-and-politics-in-the-context-of-ecological-crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All eyes have turned to the judiciary. It’s the one potential institutional check on Trump—aside, of course, from the shadowy national security state— at the federal level. The courts have the power to stop and strike down laws and actions that violate the law or the Constitution. Recent rulings by a federal district judge in Washington and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals made this clear after they blocked Trump’s Muslim and refugee bans. But the judiciary, despite pretenses to the contrary, is fundamentally political. It can shred civil rights and economic protections as efficiently as it can protect them. Ultimately, major judicial conflicts get decided by the Supreme Court, which has been split 4-4 since Republicans blocked President Obama’s effort to nominate Merrick Garland to take the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Dan Denvir speaks to Jed Purdy about the judiciary and other matters. Purdy is a professor at Duke Law and the author of three books on American political identity including The Meaning of Property. His most recent book is After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene and he has published articles in many, many publications.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/mark-blyth-how-austerity-brought-us-donald-trump%e2%80%8b</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mark Blyth wasn’t surprised by the rise of Donald Trump, nor Brexit, nor the crises spreading across Europe. He actually predicted them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blyth, the author of “Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea,” explains how economic crisis has led to upheaval in a political establishment that worked obsessively to eliminate inflation and maximize profits at the expense of general wellbeing. This crisis has produced horrific peril, as the Trump administration’s first weeks have made clear. But for the Left, it also provides historic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blyth recently spoke with Daniel Denvir during a live taping of the Dig in front of a crowd of 150 in Providence, Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>'White genocide' with George Ciccariello-Maher</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/white-genocide-with-george-ciccariello-maher</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;George Cicariello-Maher is professor of political science at Drexel University and author of several books, including Building the Commune: Radical Democracy in Venezuela, published by Verso as part of the Jacobin Series. He recently drew the ire of white supremacist, “alt-right” trolls after a mocking tweet about “white genocide,” including death threats to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more concerning was the response from Drexel Administration, which almost immediately released a statement calling his tweets “utterly reprehensible, deeply disturbing,” and stating that they “do not in any way reflect the values of the University.” Drexel eventually backed off after a public campaign in defense of Cicariello-Maher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He discusses the incident as well as issues of violence and free speech in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Diane Ravitch on Trump, DeVos and the corporate ed reform agenda</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/diane-ravitch-on-trump-devos-and-the-corporate-ed-reform-agenda"/>
   <updated>2017-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/diane-ravitch-on-trump-devos-and-the-corporate-ed-reform-agenda</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has nominated Betsy DeVos, a free-market, far-right Christian billionaire dedicated to privatizing public schools, to be his Secretary of Education. In her confirmation hearing, DeVos made it painfully clear that she has little understanding of public education aside from her dedication to destroying it. She is the heir to an auto parts fortune and her husband, Dick, is the heir to a fortune derived from the direct sales company Amway, which the FTC at one point decided was not a pyramid scheme. Interestingly, she is also the brother of Erik Prince, who founded the infamous mercenary army Blackwater has now, according to The Intercept, been quietly advising the Trump Administration. The couple, thanks to their money and relentless ideological drive, are heavy-duty power players in Michigan politics, where they have wreaked havoc on Detroit public schools. In many ways, this oligarch’s nomination is the extreme and cartoonesque outcome of decades of bipartisan corporate-aligned policy that pushed charters and high stakes testing, and attacked the teachers unions that stood in their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re joined by historian Diane Ravitch, one of the country’s leading scholars of education policy and a vocal critic of corporate reform efforts that promote privatization and high-stakes testing as the solution to problems largely created by segregation, poverty and funding inequity. Amongst many other books, Ravitch is the author of “The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is to be done? How can I get involved? Those are questions that a lot of people are asking now that Donald Trump is about to become president of the United States. Today, I speak to Nijmie Dzurinko, a Black woman who grew up poor in the deindustrialized Western Pennsylvania steel town of Monessen. Nijmie is one of the smartest and most experienced organizers we know. In the past, she has been Executive Director and organizer with the Philadelphia Student Union, was a co-founder of the Media Mobilizing Project, and is a co-founder and currently co-coordinator of the group Put People First! PA.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Glenn Greenwald on Trump and the National Security State</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/glenn-greenwald-on-trump-and-the-national-security-state"/>
   <updated>2017-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/glenn-greenwald-on-trump-and-the-national-security-state</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Presidents Bush and Obama both presided over an expansive War on Terror and a national security state with a lethal and global reach. Permanent war and warrantless snooping have become the bipartisan consensus backdrop of American politics—an immutable feature of everyday life rather than outrageous abuses to be resisted or, at least, debated. Soon, Donald Trump will become president, meaning that a man brazenly indifferent to the rule of law will be in charge of a killing and surveillance machinery that is already quite lawless. 
Today we are joined by Glenn Greenwald, a co-founding editor of The Intercept and one of the reporters who Edward Snowden entrusted with secret NSA documents exposing mass surveillance. Glenn is one of the country’s leading critics of the national security state—and the establishment media and political figures who helped pave the way to Trump’s win.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Trump didn't invent being terrible on immigration: César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández &amp; Chris Newman.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/trump-didnt-invent-being-terrible-on-immigration-cesar-cuauhtemoc-garcia-hernandez-chris-newman"/>
   <updated>2016-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/trump-didnt-invent-being-terrible-on-immigration-cesar-cuauhtemoc-garcia-hernandez-chris-newman</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and pledged to build a “a big, fat, beautiful wall” on the southern border that, of course, Mexico is going to pay for. It’s no surprise that Trump’s message struck a chord: right-wing nativism has been rising for decades and hardcore xenophobes had long since taken over the Republican Party. Worse yet, so-called immigration moderates on both sides of the aisle—including Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama—have sought to placate those reactionary forces by militarizing the border and orchestrating mass deportations. Now that Trump has won the presidency, undocumented immigrants are rightly worried and mobilizing to defend their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are joined by two guests who can help us understand where immigration politics are heading in the months to come and how we got here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández is a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law and the author of the blog “Crimmigration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Newman, Legal Director at the National Day Labor Organizing Network.&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/why-trump-won-stephanie-coontz-khalil-gibran-muhammad-and-matt-karp"/>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/why-trump-won-stephanie-coontz-khalil-gibran-muhammad-and-matt-karp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s election was shocking, if actually not so surprising, and has prompted widespread protests against a cresting right-wing reaction taking shape as a strange and potent combination of white nationalism, make-believe economic populism, libertarian orthodoxy, America-first isolationism and War on Terror extremism. It has also prompted us to relaunch this podcast. Today, we’ll be discussing why Trump won and what that says about the political moment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many apologies for the crappy quality of some of the audio. We had some technical difficulties that have been figured out for future episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guests are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Coontz teaches history and family studies at Evergreen State College, and is the author of books including “A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s” and “The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalil Gibran Muhammad is professor of History, Race and Public Policy at Harvard and the author “The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Karp is an historian at Princeton University, contributing editor at Jacobin, and the author of “This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. Please subscribe, leave a review and spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pilot: Ending the drug war means legalizing drugs</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//podcast/pilot-ending-the-drug-war-means-legalizing-drugs"/>
   <updated>2015-09-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcast/pilot-ending-the-drug-war-means-legalizing-drugs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was the pilot episode for The Dig, a podcast exploring the politics of American class warfare. This month features a discussion about ending the drug war with Sharda Sekaran of the Drug Policy Alliance and Jacob Sullum from Reason magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drug legalization looks a lot different depending on where you stand politically. But socialists and libertarians mostly agree that to end the drug war we must put a complete end to drug prohibition. We relaunched in November 2016. Subscribe and tune in for new episodes every two weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;
