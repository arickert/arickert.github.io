Two guests this episode: first, @mollyesque talks about her piece ”On Safari in Trump’s America” for Her article follows the centrist organization Third Way on a “listening tour” of the real America. Then @EricLevitz (35:52), who just published on op-ed in the entitled “America is not ‘center-right,” sorts through research to argue that what Americans often mean when they say they are “moderate” is not the combination of superficial social progressivism and neoliberalism that Wall-Street-aligned Third Way types think they mean.
