<meta name="description" content="Listen to Episode You’d be hard-pressed to find an American elected official as clear about connecting the domestic and foreign politics of US empire as Kaniela Ing. Ing is a State Representative of Hawaii and member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) running for Congress in his state’s first congressional district. Calling for an end to imperialism, as well as rule by the wealthy, strengthened housing rights, a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and free college, Ing centers how the violence the United States carries out overseas produces oppression at home. Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ing is backed by Justice Democrats. And like Ocasio-Cortez, Ing has released a powerful ad tying all his campaign’s themes together, made by the filmmakers at Means of Production. You can watch that video here. Daniel Denvir interviewed Ing about his campaign for The Dig, Denvir’s podcast on Jacobin Radio. Read the full transcript from Jacobin here." />

<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find an American elected official as clear about connecting the domestic and foreign politics of US empire as Kaniela Ing.</p>

<p>Ing is a State Representative of Hawaii and member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) running for Congress in his state’s first congressional district. Calling for an end to imperialism, as well as rule by the wealthy, strengthened housing rights, a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and free college, Ing centers how the violence the United States carries out overseas produces oppression at home.</p>

<p>Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ing is backed by Justice Democrats. And like Ocasio-Cortez, Ing has released a powerful ad tying all his campaign’s themes together, made by the filmmakers at Means of Production. You can watch that video here.</p>

<p>Daniel Denvir interviewed Ing about his campaign for The Dig, Denvir’s podcast on Jacobin Radio.</p>
