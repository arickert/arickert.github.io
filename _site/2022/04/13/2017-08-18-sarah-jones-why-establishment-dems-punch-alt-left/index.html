<p>New Republic writer Sarah Jones joins Dan to talk about Trump’s invocation of the “alt-left” and  to explain the term’s unseemly centrist history. And more. We’re gonna try doing two episodes each week now: the regular long Dig on Tuesdays and a shorter, hotter-take Diglet on Fridays. This will take more time and more money.
