  <p>wp:heading##Newsletter #23: A New Age of Empire, with Ho-fung Hung</p>

<p>by William Harris</p>

<p>I lived in Shanghai for a few years during the decade following the 2008 financial crash. This was a time in which Western journalists approached China with their mouths open. They gawked over GDP rates, the rise of preposterously large cities, the statistical delirium of a rising economy of 1.5 billion people, and the gauche ways China’s nouveau riche brandished their wealth. They gawked over rumblings of protest, and they gawked over how precarious it all seemed — how the real estate market teetered on the brink, how likely it was that this fantastical economic engine would sputter into collapse. </p>

<p>It was hard for me, too, not to sometimes see China with those eyes. Every time I would fly into Shanghai, the view on my cab ride home would change: new high rises, whole neighborhoods transformed in a matter of months, intensifying clouds of smog that the poor breathed in and the rich magicked away with air purifiers. Perhaps things were precarious, but they also seemed like emblems of a new capitalist horizon. There was a brilliant elegance to the late political economist Giovanni Arrighi’s story of succeeding world hegemons, in which a once-dominant power like Britain grew indebted to an upstart nation like the US and thus helped along the new superpower’s rise, just as centuries before, Genoese merchant capitalists had grown indebted to Holland and made possible the Dutch empire’s ascendance. Arrighi’s final book, 
<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/347-adam-smith-in-beijing"></a>, hinted that the same process might be underway again: the US as declining debtor-superpower on the verge of being surpassed by creditor-power China.</p>

<p>Yet as sociologist Ho-fung Hung explains in 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/clash-of-empires-w-ho-fung-hung/">part two of his interview</a> with 
, this hasn’t happened. Instead, China’s growth rate has fallen to more modest levels, and our era has become less one of geopolitical succession than one of confrontational geopolitical stalemate. </p>

<p>Listen to Ho-fung Hung’s interview with 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/clash-of-empires-w-ho-fung-hung/">here</a>.</p>

<p>So far, the effects of this new world have been bleak: ramped-up militarism, war. But might this geopolitical situation also provide openings? Hung suggests a Keynesian solution, where China and the US enact programs of domestic economic redistribution so growth can proceed internally, calming imperial battles over external markets. There are reasons to hope for this and reasons to remain skeptical: the imbalance of class forces, the environmental consequences of expanded consumption. </p>

<p>But Hung also mentions a second opening to watch out for. “Our analysis focuses too much on big powers and big empires without paying enough attention to smaller states,” Hung says. From Tanzania to the Philippines, nationalism is on the rise across the world, and multi-polarity provides small states the chance to play big powers against each other. This could just lead to exacerbated tensions — but it could lead, too, to more room for small left-leaning regimes, like the ones once again on the rise in Latin America.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #22: Capitalist China, with Ho-fung Hung</p>

<p>By Mack Penner</p>

<p>What an 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/china-boom-w-ho-fung-hung/">episode</a>: in a little over an hour, Ho-fung Hung, author of 
<a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-china-boom/9780231164191"></a>, covers more than two centuries of political-economic development in China, all the while weaving in and out of Marxist accumulation theory, Immanuel Wallersteinian world-systems theory, and 
 historiography. What more could we ask for?</p>

<p>There are, importantly, two time-scales at work in the interview: a period of centuries over which China occupied a subordinate position in the workings of global capitalism; and a more recent period, only a couple of decades in existence, during which China has become a superpower. The forthcoming second episode with Hung, on the financial crisis of 2008 and more, delves further into the latter period. </p>

<p>China’s rise over recent decades has been dramatic, so it can seem novel. As former 
 guest Isabella Weber points out in her book, 
<a href="https://www.routledge.com/How-China-Escaped-Shock-Therapy-The-Market-Reform-Debate/Weber/p/book/9781032008493"></a>, from 1990 to 2017, the Chinese share of global GDP went from hardly more than 2 percent to nearly 13 percent. Today, according to the 
<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">World Bank</a>, the 
<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN">Chinese share</a> is well above 15 percent. If the Chinese Communist Party can meet its 
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b96db9c0-5e92-4957-96d0-cbf44ebf7425">goals</a> for economic growth, modest only by recent Chinese standards, China could represent fully one-fifth of world GDP. </p>

<p>These figures are stunning. But as we learn in the episode, China’s subordinate geoeconomic status in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the real historical anomaly. In the early modern period, and for centuries on-and-off beforehand, Chinese society was characterized by high living standards and flourishing commerce. As Hung notes in 
, citing political scientist Joseph Nye, recent Chinese history is actually better understood as a “renaissance” than a “rise.” </p>

<p>argues that despite growing Chinese geoeconomic and geopolitical power, China is unlikely to fundamentally upend the global capitalist system in the long term — in part because it has benefitted from that system. This point rhymes with the analysis of some other observers: 
<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674987593">Branko Milanovic</a>, for example, suggests that competition between China and the United States is a contest between versions of capitalism rather than a clash of fundamentally different systems. A China-dominated world system would still be a capitalist world system. </p>

<p>So what should we make of the China boom? We might get our bearings by keeping one eye on each of the time scales that feature in the episode. In the short term, we should remember that inter-imperial rivalry between large capitalist states doesn’t have a great track record, to say the least. Panning out, we might want to consider the final passages in 
, where Hung calls it “unthinkable that the upcoming crises might be more daunting than the ones China has weathered over the centuries” and predicts that “its robust capitalist development will continue for a long time.” </p>

<p>But as we consider the possibility, in China and elsewhere, of further capitalist development over the long-term, the obvious question is: how long do we have? As Kate Aronoff has argued on 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/climate-politics-with-kate-aronoff/"></a>, even if the end of capitalism is not likely to come for a long time, managing the climate crisis still urgently requires a “
<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/08/capitalism-climate-crisis-global-green-new-deal-clean-energy-fossil-fuel-industry">radical shift in our current economic order.</a>” In the long run, however long it turns out to be, the battle over what that radical shift will look like is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Speaking of Isabella Weber, her 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/how-china-escaped-shock-therapy-w-isabella-weber/">interview</a> with 
 is a clear archival complement to Hung’s two-part interview. Hung’s new book, 
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/east-asian-government-politics-and-policy/clash-empires-chimerica-new-cold-war?format=PB"></a>, will be out shortly. </p>

<p>It’s springtime in the northern hemisphere, meaning that summer reading plans are being made. Hung’s references to debates in the theory and history of capitalism could make for inspiration. You might dabble in the capitalist transition debates via the “
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/history/european-history-1000-1450/brenner-debate-agrarian-class-structure-and-economic-development-pre-industrial-europe?format=PB">Brenner Debate</a>.” Or you might read Immanuel Wallerstein’s 
<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/World-Systems-Analysis/">introduction to world-systems analysis</a>. The really good stuff, however, is 
 history and historiography. Summer 2022 as the summer of 
<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520081147/civilization-and-capitalism-15th-18th-century-vol-i">Fernand Braudel</a>, anyone?</p>

<p>##Newsletter #21: A Left Internationalist Response to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, with Sophie Pinkham and Nick Mulder</p>

<p>By Michal Schatz</p>

<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended the global economy and thrown the future of the international political order into question. This new conjuncture raises key questions about foreign policy and internationalism that the US left has tended to subordinate to domestic issues.The 
Dig’s<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/">interview</a>with Sophie Pinkham and Nick Mulder highlights what’s at stake in global politics at the moment — and makes clear why today’s Left must develop not only an anti-imperialist foreign policy agenda, but a positive vision for left internationalism.</p>

<p>As shelling continues in cities across Ukraine and crippling sanctions are rapidly tanking the Russian economy, the question everyone across the political spectrum keeps asking iswhyRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine without threat or provocation. Mulder points out that the USSR’s dissolution was not a discrete event, but the beginning of a process of imperial collapse. Russia’s recent aggression could be understood as a continuation of this process. This is useful to remember when thinking about global politics beyond the war. Many US Cold War elites and their neoliberal progeny saw in the Soviet Union’s disintegration a permanent victory for American power, but history is constantly unfolding; the unipolar power that the United States claimed in the wake of Soviet dissolution was perhaps an extension of that collapse.</p>

<p>This moment demands a renewal of robust Left internationalism. The resurgence of the US left since Trump’s 2016 election has reframed key aspects of domestic politics, but we have yet to develop an equivalent for foreign policy. Today’s US left is rightly anti-imperialist and anti-militarist, but without a corresponding vision for what we are seeking to build in its place, these positions end up manifesting as circumscribed responses to discrete conflicts with few concrete demands. Anti-imperialism does not mean retreating from international politics but developing both domestic and foreign policy programs in solidarity with working people globally. As<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/aziz-rana/">Aziz 
Rana</a>wrote forJacobinin 2019, internationalist thinking about domestic problems is a critical prerequisite to building any Left foreign policy agenda.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #20: Slapping Back the Invisible Hand, with Kim Phillips-Fein</p>

<p>Over the past two years, the belief that left-wing activism is responsible for a surge of right-wing reaction has become a sort of catechism for talking heads and mainstream Democrats who insist that calls to “defund the police” are the single greatest threat to the Democratic Party’s political prospects. For want of immediate evidence, centrists intone sagely about the election of 1972, when George McGovern and his radical supporters pushed white, middle-class suburbanites into the arms of Richard Nixon.</p>

<p>Kim Phillips-Fein’s 2009 bookInvisible 
Hands: 
The 
Businessmen’s 
Crusade 
Against 
the 
New 
Dealargues against this “backlash” narrative. Phillips-Fein locates the roots of the Right’s rise not in the cultural politics of the New Left, but in the 1930s, when a small group of wealthy businessmen refused to accommodate themselves to the New Deal order. Though their fierce opposition to the welfare state put them at the political margins during the 1930s, these reactionaries helped tame American liberalism in the 1940s and 1950s while laying the groundwork for the Reagan Revolution.</p>

<p>Through the institutions they built and the networks of conservative businessmen they cultivated, opponents of the New Deal waged a decades-long war to transform the ways that Americans thought about the market, organized labor, and the role of federal government. Above all else, they worked to convince people — in particular cultural conservatives — that free enterprise and entrepreneurship represented the highest expressions of human freedom, and thus that any effort at asserting democratic control over the generation and distribution of wealth, must be understood as an assault on the most cherished values of a free people.</p>

interview

Kim 
Phillips-Fein 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/invisible-hands-w-kim-phillips-fein/">here</a>.</p>

<p>At first glance, we canalmostreadInvisible 
Handsas a road map for the contemporary Left: an example of how a small band of committed activists can, over the course of decades of steadfast political commitment, transform mainstream assumptions about economics and politics. But we should be wary of drawing too many direct lessons from this story. After all, few leftists have the cash, and few one-percenters have the inclination, to fund this sort of ideological campaign.</p>

<p>Still, there are lessons to be gleaned from Phillips-Fein’s interpretation of the conservative movement. As we search for a useable past, we should look for links and threads across eras. Just as the roots of the neoliberalism of the 1980s and 1990s might be found in the early New Deal, the roots of some future Left may be found in social formations and forms of protest which seem marginal today.</p>

<p>As Phillips-Fein and Dan discuss in this week’s interview, the limits of the libertarian worldview have been put into particularly sharp relief in recent years. It is — or at least it should be — impossible to view exposure to an airborne pandemic as a matter of individual responsibility. And yet, from the<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bidens-pandemic-w-justin-feldman/">Biden 
administration’s 
push 
for 
a 
return 
to 
normal</a>while a pandemic still rages, to the<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/cryptocurrency-w-edward-ongweso-jr-jacob-silverman/">feverish 
utopianism</a>around<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/private-money-with-stefan-eich/">cryptocurrency</a>, evidence of the persistence of this vision are all around us.</p>

<p>We live in the world these businessmen helped build. But while leftists may not be in a position to precisely trace the path of the businessmen’s crusade,Invisible 
Handsshould remind us that the political certainties of today may be anything but certain tomorrow.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #19: War in Ukraine on a Burning Planet, with Tony Wood</p>

<p>By Mack Penner </p>

<p>Developments from the war in Ukraine, ongoing for a week as I write this, are moving at a frenzied pace. Keeping up with the reporting seems to require hours of attention daily; keeping up with analysis of the war is at least equally challenging, as for every cogent and considered piece there are a great many more that are not worth the time of day. Which makes 
’s 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/russia-invades-w-tony-wood/">interview</a> with Tony Wood, author of 
, a welcome anchor. </p>

<p>Against the backdrop of war, there are few certainties, especially when it comes to matters of geopolitics. But as Wood discusses in the interview, current geopolitical uncertainty runs up against the very sure thing of climate change. Mitigating the worst outcomes of climate change requires concerted state action at the global level — and such action is nigh impossible to imagine in a warming world at war. </p>

<p>Accordingly, it’s worth highlighting the 
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5de27c61-0095-4add-8076-7469b27a4bb8">recent news</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which released the 
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/">latest portion</a> of its major report. The previous installment was 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/ipcc-reports-verdict-on-climate-crimes-of-humanity-guilty-as-hell">big news</a> at the end of last summer; this one appeared much more quietly, three days into the Russian invasion. The findings conclude that the consequences of climate change are likely to be worse than previously thought. And what was previously thought wasn’t exactly rosy. </p>

<p>The IPCC report is a litany of disasters both looming and already-arrived: destroyed ecosystems, rapidly rising seas, extreme weather, and trillions of dollars in damage and losses, to say nothing of the unquantifiable suffering that will be endured by living things. The “window of opportunity” in which human actions can intervene to stave off the worst and ensure the continuing habitability of the earth is closing. </p>

<p>War imperils our collective ability to address the climate crisis. So, with war ongoing (
<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/02/joe-biden-war-yemen-us-foreign-policy-humanitarian-crisis">and not only in Ukraine</a>), what is to be done? Clearly left internationalism, anti-war and anti-capitalist, is required by the moment. Solidarity with the people of Ukraine goes without saying. </p>

<p>    On the war in Ukraine, be sure to have a look at the 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/russia-invades-w-tony-wood/">show notes</a>. Otherwise, I recommend stepping out of the current discursive fervor and reading 
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/gift-time-introduction/">Jonathan Schell’s argument for the abolition of nuclear weapons</a>, written more than twenty years ago and unfortunately still-relevant. For an understanding of Putin that you won’t get from the mainstream media, read Wood’s 
<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2839-russia-without-putin"></a>.</p>

<p>    Read Andreas Malm’s opus, 
<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2002-fossil-capital"></a>, on the history of our current climate predicaments. Read Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright’s 
<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3138-climate-leviathan"></a> on where we might go from here. And 
 has an 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/environment/">extensive archive of climate episodes</a>. Kate Aronoff’s 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/climate-politics-with-kate-aronoff/">interview</a> would be a good place to start. </p>

<p>##Newsletter #18: A Radical — and Popular — Feminism in Latin America and Around the World, with Verónica Gago</p>

<p>by Maia Silber</p>

<p>Left feminists in the Global North have long lamented the corporate cooptation of the movement’s mainstream, even as more radical visions of gender justice seem unable to reach beyond the academy. But in Argentina, an international feminist movement has emerged that is both massive in its popular reach and unabashed in its insistence on linking the struggle against patriarchy to struggles against colonialism and neoliberal capitalism. It offers a model for activists around the world who want to use feminist analysis and tactics not only to advance women’s status within the existing order, but to transform that order.</p>

<p>This week’s guest, Verónica Gago, is a political theorist, organizer, and member of Ni Una Menos (“Not One Less”), a Latin America–wide feminist collective that gained a global following in 2016 when it launched a women’s general strike following the rape and murder of sixteen-year-old Lucia Pérez. Gago’s work underscores the decades-old socialist-feminist argument that Ni Una Menos puts into practice: capitalism devalues “women’s work” by rendering it invisible 
aswork, and insisting on naming it as such can powerfully expand the horizons of labor organizing beyond the conventional setting of the shop floor.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to</strong>
<strong>The Dig’s</strong><strong>interview with Verónica Gago</strong>
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/feminist-international-w-veronica-gago/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<p>Ni Una Menos also inspired the International Women’s Strike (IWS) in 2017, which dovetailed in the United States with the resurgence of mainstream feminist activism following Donald Trump’s election. But while in Latin America, the IWS fed a growing movement that has subsequently launched mass protests against debt-fueling international monetary policy and austerity, the IWS in the United States was an isolated event with a disappointing turnout and negligible consequences. The contrast suggests that by linking women’s oppression to the broader erosion of social support under neoliberalism — rather than a narrow partisan agenda or a liberal demand for professional representation — US feminists might actually broaden their mass appeal.</p>

<p>Listening to Gago, I wondered if the pandemic might provide such an opportunity. While liberal feminists in the United States have occasionally lamented the pandemic’s consequences for women’s career opportunities, left feminists here might take a cue from Ni Una Menos to link increased care burdens for women to the state’s ongoing efforts to make private households responsible for collective health risks in the form of climate hazards, chronic disease, and occuupational dangers. Rather than simply attributing women’s pandemic woes to inequitable distributions of labor within the household, feminists taking aim at the neoliberal state might find common cause with existing pandemic campaigns against evictions, unsafe workplaces, and incarceration.</p>

<p>The feminist strike, as Gago envisions it, is a means of uniting community members in a shared process of both hardship and care. In Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, that strike has been used to connect violence against women to the seizure of indigenous land and the imposition of household debt; elsewhere, that could mean connecting the demands of waged workers to those of welfare recipients or the victims of climate disasters. The key to building a feminism of the masses might be identifying gender as a cornerstone of today’s capitalist order.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #17: The Maladies of Colonial Capitalism, with Raj Patel and Rupa Marya</p>

<p>By Mack Penner </p>

<p>As 
’s 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/inflamed-w-raj-patel-and-rupa-marya/">interview</a> with Raj Patel and Rupa Marya makes clear, there are countless ways capitalism and colonialism are detrimental to human health. Accordingly, the interview and the book on which it is based, Patel and Marya’s 
<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374602529/inflamed"></a>, is many things at once: a history of health regimes and food systems under capitalism, a critique of the modern medical system, and an argument for decolonized medicine, to mention a few. </p>

<p>Listening to the interview, I was thinking about the relationship between Patel and Marya’s arguments and the history of Canada. One of the key ideas in the interview is the notion that health is related to our “exposome,” or the totality of our encounters with the world around us 
 the histories and structural logics that make our world what it is. As Marya explains in the interview, trauma is one of the most damaging aspects of the exposome, especially because it is transmitted across generations. The history of the Canadian settler colony, particularly its ongoing brutalization of its indigenous population, stands as evidence. </p>

<p>On this point, a couple of recent works on Canadian colonialism and the health of indigenous peoples come to mind. In 
<a href="https://uofrpress.ca/Books/C/Clearing-the-Plains"></a>, a widely noted and awarded work first published in 2014, James Daschuk explains the awful contemporary disparities in health outcomes between indigenous peoples and non-indigenous Canadians. To do this, Daschuk scans a period of centuries in which dispossession, disease, and famine, brought by settlers and its state agents, combined to impose and entrench ill health in indigenous communities. </p>

<p>The book is perhaps best known for the evidence it marshals to show that, in nineteenth-century western Canada, starvation was an intentionally imposed state policy used as a method of control to aid in settlement and the imposition of market capitalism in that region. It is common to acknowledge that Canadian settler colonialism entailed a form of “cultural genocide.” In fact, the qualifier is misleading. This history helps us understand the intergenerational toxicity of settler-colonial exposomes. </p>

<p>For 
 listeners interested in exploring these questions further, Daschuk’s book would be well-complemented by Mary Jane Logan McCallum and Adele Perry’s 
<a href="https://uofmpress.ca/books/detail/structures-of-indifference"></a>, which is focused on the city of Winnipeg and the thirty-four hour period in 2008 during which Brian Sinclair, a non-status Anishinaabe man, was left neglected and untreated in an emergency room, eventually dying from a treatable infection. By historicizing Sinclair’s death, McCallum and Perry show how “structures of indifference” are core to the settler-colonial exposome and its very real, everyday effects in contemporary Canada. </p>

<p>On the matter of capitalism and health care, Gabriel Winant’s 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/next-shift-with-gabriel-winant/">recent episode</a> is a must. From further back in the archive, you might want to revisit Leo Beletsky’s

<p>##Newsletter #16: The Real Story of What’s Happening in Ukraine, with Volodymyr Ishchenko</p>

<p>by William Harris</p>

<p>You could be forgiven for being confused about what’s happening in Ukraine. On the one hand, unless you have an admirable ability to tune out the mainstream US press, you have heard that Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed troops somewhere in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, and that a Russian invasion is now imminent. On the other hand, if you 
have been able to escape the insular punditry of these media narratives, you have perhaps heard the Ukrainian president say not only that war is not imminent, but also that the Biden administration should stop needlessly inciting tension and hysteria.</p>

<p>What is happening? What motivates the Biden administration to inflate the likelihood of war? What motivates Putin to escalate conflict with Ukraine? And what, amid all this trumped-up war talk, do Ukraine’s own very different and competing political constituencies want?</p>

<p>This week’s 
Digepisode features Ukrainian sociologist Volodymyr Ishchenko, a brilliant analyst of 
<a href="https://lefteast.org/contradictions-post-soviet-ukraine-failure-ukraine-new-left/">social movements</a>, 
<a href="https://www.ponarseurasia.org/how-maidan-revolutions-reproduce-and-intensify-the-post-soviet-crisis-of-political-representation/">revolutions</a>, and the 
<a href="https://lefteast.org/ukraine-in-the-vicious-circle-of-the-post-soviet-crisis-of-hegemony/">crises of the post-Soviet world</a>, who contextualizes all these questions and more by placing the current conflict in a long history that reaches back to World War II, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the 2014 Maidan Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to</strong>
<strong>The Dig</strong><strong>’s interview with Volodymyr Ishchenko</strong>
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/ukraine-w-volodymyr-ishchenko/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>In 2014, Ukraine’s then-president Viktor Yanukovych reneged at the last minute on a free-trade agreement with the European Union, accepting instead a different agreement with Russia. Small crowds protested in Kiev’s main square, or “maidan.” In a strange episode still shrouded in mystery — did Yanukovvych order it? was it a false flag? — the crowds were violently dispersed, a needless act of aggression that swelled the protests and eventually led to revolution.</p>

<p>In the ensuing years, Ukrainian politics have grown sharply polarized between a liberal and nationalist camp, boasting an uneasy alliance of West-looking neoliberals and far-right extremists; and a Russia-aligned camp that plays up Ukraine’s deep cultural, linguistic, and economic ties to the massive power to its north and east.</p>

<p>Yet as Ishchenko argues, this culturally inflected, identitarian hyper-polarization — spurred along by large influxes of US military aid on the one hand and Putin’s propaganda machine on the other — leaves out the vast majority of Ukrainians, who remain depoliticized, culturally bound to both Russia and Ukrainian nationalism, and faced with the economic pressures of life in a poor country that has greatly accelerated neoliberal austerity since 2014.</p>

<p>Ishchenko argues the Left has room to break out of this impasse — though for reasons of leftist historical fragility, all that currently appears on the horizon is depoliticization and polarization on the domestic front, and saber-rattling and propaganda internationally.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #15: Joe Biden Has Failed in His Fight Against Coronavirus, with Justin Feldman</p>

<p>by Benjamin Feldman</p>

<p>Last January, Joe Biden entered office promising to win the war against coronavirus. Four months later, Center for Disease Control director Rachelle Wolensky announced that vaccinated Americans could take off their masks, and on July 4, Biden declared something like victory over the pandemic, telling the nation that “while the virus hasn’t been vanquished, … it no longer controls our lives, it no longer paralyzes our nation, and it’s within our power to make sure it never does so again.” In the months since that victory speech, tens of millions of Americans have been infected with the virus, and more than 250,000 have died. </p>

<p>Though the extent of Delta’s pathogenicity or Omicron’s immune evasiveness were not predicted, epidemiologists have long insisted that until the rest of the world is vaccinated, new variants will keep coming. Why, then, was the Biden administration so unprepared? And why have they barely deviated from a vaccine-only response, which, though it may have made sense in January 2021, has been wholly inadequate to January 2022? </p>

<p>These are the questions that social epidemiologist Justin Feldman tackles in his 
<a href="https://jmfeldman.medium.com/a-year-in-how-has-biden-done-on-pandemic-response-88452c696f2">recent overview of Biden’s pandemic response</a> and in his conversation with 
. </p>

<p>Feldman argues that, led by Jeffrey Zients — a consultant who helped the Obama administration “streamline processes [and] cut costs,” in between stints on the boards of Sirius XM and Facebook — the White House bet on avoiding politically risky non-pharmaceutical interventions — contact tracing, mass testing, temporary closures of non-essential businesses, and any policy that would irk business by impeding proftimaking — and keep the economy humming while we marched toward herd immunity. Though they lost this bet, the administration has largely refused to reverse course, even as infections soared above 800,000 each day. </p>

<p>Listen to’s 
interview with Justin Feldman<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bidens-pandemic-w-justin-feldman/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Rather than using state resources to fight and minimize infections, Biden has treated the socialized risks of life in a pandemic as matters of personal responsibility, and the administration has taken to lashing out at those it sees as standing in the way of a return to normalcy. Teachers are demonized for not wanting to return to schools, despite those schools being transformed into little more than holding pens for both sick and not-yet-sick children so their parents can get back to work. Those who have yet to get their first shot are treated as an undifferentiated mass of intransigent MAGA supporters — even though, Feldman writes, “the unvaccinated are largely low-income, uninsured, pregnant, incarcerated, and children” (to say nothing of the immunocompromised for whom vaccination provides insufficient protection). </p>

<p>By dragging their feet on distributing masks, undermining rapid tests, failing to provide better air filtration, and telling people to return to work while still potentially infectious, the administration has contributed mightily to the chaos and suffering of the last few weeks. As Feldman makes clear, these failures were not inevitable and must not be treated as such. They are failures of a Democratic administration’s policy and personnel, of individual people unable to learn from their mistakes and unwilling to prioritize people over profits. </p>

<p>There’s no shortage of pandemic coverage out there, of course. But you can read Feldman’s recent Medium post

<p>##Newsletter #14: Building Left Power in Disorienting Times, with Aziz Rana, Nikhil Pal Singh, and Wendy Brown</p>

<p>by William Harris</p>

<p>What sort of times are we living through? As legal scholar Aziz Rana puts it in a blockbuster new 
Diginterview that also features fellow 
Digsuperguests Nikhil Pal Singh, a historian, and Wendy Brown, a political philosopher, we live in a moment “consumed by history.” Nostalgia suffuses our politics. Myths of a vanished world of white, male breadwinners benignly lording over devout nuclear families propel an ever-zanier series of endless culture wars. “Critical Race Theory,” trans people using bathrooms, the politics of mask-wearing and vaccine mandates — the Right has become incredibly adept at politicizing manufactured controversies to strip away or capture the institutions of representative democracy, from local school boards to the Supreme Court, the gerrymandering of electoral districts to draconian voter ID laws.</p>

<p>These particular culture wars are at once, as Singh reminds us, “ruptural,” or genuinely new political phenomena, and “continuous,” part of a long American postwar story. With this in mind, our guests try to figure out how exactly to conceive of our moment. Does the Right have a positive political project, or is it now merely destructive? How should the Left respond to a disorienting culture war terrain in which the stage seems always set by the Right? And in a time of ecological devastation, US imperial decadence, and democratic erosion, the age-old question still presents itself: how can the Left build power?</p>

<p><strong>Listen to</strong>
<strong>The Dig</strong><strong>’s interview with Aziz Rana, Nikhil Pal Singh, and Wendy Brown</strong>
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/interregnum-w-aziz-rana-nikhil-pal-singh-wendy-brown/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Building Left institutional power requires taking stock of the existing institutional landscape. Our guests map the major institutions within the broad left-of-center field and debate which ones, if any, might allow us to push forward socialist politics. Real disagreements arise — over how much primacy to afford the labor movement, and over how the Left can organize the unorganized — and we end up without “easy answers,” as 
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nikhil_palsingh/status/1479480900094210050?cxt=HHwWhMC54ceClogpAAAA">Singh wrote on Twitter</a>. But two takeaways stand out.</p>

<p>We come away with a rare synthetic view of the present, equally attendant to the 
longue durée of neoliberalism and the insane rush of the day’s news cycle. We come away, too, with a rare sense of hope. We live in a time “consumed by history,” to quote Rana again, when the “past order has broken down, and yet we don’t really have an idea of what’s going to come next.” This can open the door to useless and even reactionary nostalgia, but it can also invite us to learn anew from the dreams and achievements of past Left movements — and to feel our own time, despite its bleakness, as up for grabs.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #13: A Path Forward for Workers in Rust Belt America, with Gabriel Winant</p>

<p>by Benjamin Feldman</p>

<p>Between the recognition of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1937 and their 116-day strike in 1959, Pittsburgh’s steelworkers fought for — and won — health and disability insurance, pensions, consistent wage increases, and a slice of decency and dignity on the job. Sixty years later, steel is only Pittsburgh’s sixteenth largest employer, and roughly one out of every five workers in the Steel City works in health care or social assistance. </p>

<p>That service work has eclipsed manufacturing across the Rust Belt is well-understood. Less understood is the argument at the center of 
<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674238091">Gabriel Winant’s </a>: that the industrial economy 
 the care economy. Reconstructing the “social world” that Pittsburgh steel made, Winant shows that “as the industrial basis of this world began to collapse, its inhabitants … drew on the resources they had, embedded in the relationships and identities they had already built. …Their world was melted down and recast,” Winant writes, “but it was still made from the same materials.”</p>

<p>Pittsburgh’s economy was built and maintained through a series of compromises, which temporarily defended the economic citizenship of a mostly white and male cohort of union workers in part (but only in part) through the exclusion of large numbers of women and African Americans. Winant shows that, as manufacturing crumbled, these excluded workers found jobs in the area’s rapidly expanding network of hospitals and nursing homes — an expansion
 made possible by financialization and necessitated by the increasing health care needs of a mid-century labor force prematurely aged by the ravages of a lifetime in the mills. The low wages paid to this mostly non-union, and disproportionately Black and female, workforce have led to Pittsburgh having one of the 
<a href="https://pittsburghunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-Day-in-the-Neighborhood.pdf">highest African-American poverty rates in</a> the United States.</p>

<p>Beyond untangling the roots of the increasingly precarious, contingent, and uncertain economy of the twenty-first century, Winant suggests a possible path forward — one that does not rely on nostalgia for the mid-twentieth century’s industrial labor force. Instead, Winant offers a vision of a shared politics wherein both those receiving care 
 the essential workers providing that care unite in struggle for a more inclusive social citizenship. </p>

<p>##Newsletter #12: Money Is Inherently Political, with Stefan Eich</p>

<p>By Mack Penner </p>

<p>For the truest believers, cryptocurrency promises utopia. Following Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, their central claim is that decentralized currency beyond the control of states and banks promises a utopian economic life beyond politics. This is, of course, entirely false — and not just in the sense that crypto actually functions as yet another instrument for financial speculation. </p>

<p>The anti-political utopian claims made on behalf of cryptocurrency, political theorist Stefan Eich argues, are rhetorical cover for what is ultimately just a recent episode in a long history of ideological battles over money, which is always political. </p>

<p>Listen to’s interview with Stefan Eich<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/private-money-with-stefan-eich/">here</a>. </p>

<p>Contemporary debates over crypto can be traced back, at least, to the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s. Bretton Woods was a system of international monetary arrangements and financial regulations that included stringent capital controls and “fixed but flexible” exchange rates where currencies were pegged to the dollar and the dollar was tied to gold. This system effectively ceased to function in 1971 and formally ended in 1973 as a result of the inflation crisis. To tame that crisis,  Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker jacked interest rates sky high — a shift that, among other things, helped break the power of American unions and usher in decades’ worth of skyrocketing inequality. The “moderate” fiscal policy ushered in by Volcker lasted until the 2008 financial crisis. Within weeks of the crash, Nakamoto published the initial proposal for Bitcoin. </p>

<p>Between the end of Bretton Woods and 2008, intense political battles over money played out. As a precursor to crypto, Eich focuses on the proposals of neoliberal paragon Friedrich Hayek for a “denationalized” private money that would liberate money markets from the influence of states. The monetary policies that emerged after Bretton Woods, influenced by thinkers like Hayek, clearly worked in the interests of wealthy capitalist states at the forefront of neoliberalism; structural adjustment programs imposed on poorer countries by the International Monetary Fund, which made loans conditional upon their implementing neoliberal policies, proved devastating.</p>

<p>Leftists today should recognize the interests that are served by schemes for anti-political money, to effectively counter them. In rejecting cryptocurrency, we have an opportunity to confront the deeply unjust post-Bretton Woods order — and build a left politics of democratic money. </p>

<p>##Newsletter #11: The False Promises of Cryptocurrency with Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman</p>

<p>by Maia Silber</p>

<p>The global market in cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of more than $2 trillion. Celebrities from Kim Kardashian to Elon Musk to Spike Lee have touted the benefits of decentralized, digital forms of money, promising that they will democratize finance by freeing ordinary investors from the tyranny of Wall Street and central banks.</p>

<p>But far from liberating them, argue journalists Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman, “crypto” distributors entrap their users in speculative gambits akin to multilevel marketing schemes.</p>

<p>Digital asset exchanges make use of blockchain, a publicly distributed ledger that records transactions with encrypted data that cannot be retroactively altered. Some early boosters hoped that blockchain’s combination of transparency and privacy (the identities of individual users are not recorded) could be harnessed for socially beneficial means — for instance, to facilitate government or corporate whistleblowing. Mostly, though, crypto companies have exploited the technology for the creation of highly speculative markets in private money.</p>

<p>Listen toThe Dig’sinterview with Edward Ongweso, Jr. and Jacob Silverman<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/cryptocurrency-w-edward-ongweso-jr-jacob-silverman/">here.</a></p>

<p>Unbacked by governments and unattached to real commodities, the “value” of crypto derives entirely from the fluctuating demand for its artificially limited supply. Crypto promoters often advertise explicitly speculative schemes such as “pump and dumps,” where users are encouraged to rapidly buy up a currency in order to inflate its value before offloading their stash — schemes in which it is not uncommon for the organizers and some participants to have secretly bought in early.</p>

<p>The winners of such risky games are rarely ordinary users. More often, they are a small number of connected and highly capitalized individuals, some of them backed by major investment firms.</p>

<p>Ongweso and Silverman see crypto’s false promise of egalitarianism as one of its most pernicious aspects. In an advertisement for the digital currency machine company Coin Cloud, Spike Lee urges viewers to reject the government currency that “systematically oppresses” and join the “digital revolution.” While funk music plays, he addresses himself to the millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color, who are unbanked and underbanked — never mind that investing in an extremely volatile asset is hardly advisable for those who are financially insecure.</p>

<p>Like welfare privatization and the gig economy, then, crypto promises to equalize “opportunity” while removing public protections so that the already-rich can get even richer. This is no new digital utopia, argue Ongweso and Silverman, but the old story of enclosure, further dispossessing the already dispossessed.</p>

<p>This is the first installment of our two-episode series on crypto. Next week, political theorist Stephen Eich situates crypto in the long history of political fights over money.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #10: How Neoliberalism Creates Right-Wing Reaction, with Rodrigo Nunes</p>

<p>By Mack Penner</p>

<p>As far-right movements have proliferated across the globe, often on the strength of popular support significant enough to win elections, the relationship between neoliberalism and the politics of reaction has become an urgent problem for the Left. Decades of neoliberal governance, deeply undemocratic in their own right, have helped create an openly anti-democratic politics that is often hateful and violent.</p>

<p>The second of back-to-back episodes on Brazil (you can listen to the first, with historian Andre Pagliarini and sociologist Sabrina Fernandes, 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/brazil-w-sabrina-fernandes-andre-pagliarini/">here</a>), 
’s interview with Rodrigo Nunes takes the politics of Bolsonarismo as a case study for assessing these developments. In a 
<a href="https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/of-what-is-bolsonaro-the-name">pair</a> of 
<a href="http://www.publicbooks.org/are-we-in-denial-about-denial/">essays</a> published last year, Nunes argues that core to neoliberalism’s creation of widespread right-wing reaction is a kind of “denialism.” </p>

<p>While neoliberalism has created increasing political and economic dissatisfaction among large groups of people, that dissatisfaction has not exclusively or even primarily led to the emergence of a new anti-capitalist common sense around which left movements can readily mobilize. Instead, politicians like Jair Bolsonaro and other reactionary populists have capitalized on popular discontent and directed it towards reactionary ends. </p>

<p>Listen to’s interview with Rodrigo Nunes<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bolsonarismo-with-rodrigo-nunes/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The denialist sword is double-edged: people in an unconscious denial about the causes of their problems become eager consumers of conscious denial, happily supplied by reactionaries like Bolsonaro. As Nunes puts it at the conclusion of an essay in 
, denialism “seals an alliance between those gearing up for surviving in worsening conditions and an elite increasingly at ease with the idea that ‘the earth no longer has enough room for them and for everyone else.’”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nunes’s interview with 
 is the latest entry in a series of episodes about neoliberalism, democracy, and the social politics of the Right. Previously, political theorist Wendy Brown has 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/ruins-of-neoliberalism-with-wendy-brown/">discussed</a> her book 
<a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/in-the-ruins-of-neoliberalism/9780231193856"></a>, about how neoliberalism has legitimized anti-democratic politics. Historian Quinn Slobodian was 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/a-history-of-neoliberalism-with-quinn-slobodian/">interviewed</a> about his book 
<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674979529"></a>, which traces the fear of democracy through the intellectual history of neoliberalism. And in a 
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/family-values-with-melinda-cooper-2/">classic episode</a>, sociologist Melinda Cooper talks about her book 
<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9781935408345/family-values"></a>, on the symbiotic relationship between neoliberals and social conservatives. </p>

<p>##<strong>Newsletter #9: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro Is a “Major Threat to Life on the Planet”</strong></p>

<p>By Micah Uetricht</p>

<p>Observing Brazil from the United States, especially during the Trump years, it was hard not to be struck with a sense of déjà vu. Watching populist far-right president Jair Bolsonaro often feels similar to watching former president Donald Trump: the corruption is so unabashed and complete, the incompetence so absurd, leftists often have remind themselves not to be distracted from the actual substance of their governance, a horror show of cruelty and misery that both men have inflicted upon their respective countries and the entire world.</p>

<p>But in Brazil, these horrors have come after some of the greatest advances for the poor and working class that any society on the planet has seen in the past half century or more, carried out under wildly popular Workers Party leader and former (and possibly future) Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In 2011, historian Perry Anderson called Lula “the most successful politician of his time.” </p>

<p>But the series of events that played out in Latin America’s largest country over the next few years were dizzying: Lula’s successor Dilma Roussef was impeached in what many deemed a “constitutional coup”; Bolsonaro won the presidency, producing a cavalcade of anti-working-class, homophobic and misogynist, ecological, and public-health disasters; and Lula was imprisoned for a year and a half on bogus corruption charges, a victim of a supposed anti-corruption campaign that was later revealed to be simply a tool of right-wing political warfare. </p>

<p>Brazil’s politics can be difficult for outsiders to understand. Luckily, for this episode, we have two Brazil scholars as our guides: Andre Pagliarini, a historian at Hampden-Sydney College, columnist at 
, and author of a forthcoming book on Brazilian nationalism; and Sabrina Fernandes, a sociologist, postdoctoral fellow at the International Research Group on Authoritarianism and Counter-Strategies through the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, and lead editor for 
.</p>

<p>Listen to’s interview with Pagliarini and Fernandes<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/brazil-w-sabrina-fernandes-andre-pagliarini/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Fernandes sums up Bolsonaro’s presidency succinctly: “He’s a major threat to life in the country and, if we consider geopolitical issues and ecological issues, to life on the planet,” </p>

<p>This episode is the first of two 
 episodes on Brazil and Bolsonaro. You can listen to the next episode on Bolsonarismo with Brazilian leftist scholar Rodrigo Nunes

<p>##Newsletter #8: Cuba’s Key Role in Fighting Apartheid in Angola Is All but Forgotten Today</p>

<p>By Michal Schatz</p>

<p>The term “Cold War” is a misnomer. While open conflict never broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union directly in the roughly four decades after World War II, the two superpowers fought bloody proxy wars across the Global South, from Korea and Vietnam to Ethiopia and Southern Africa. Recent scholarship on decolonization in the twentieth century has shown that, contrary to conventional narratives which depict countries like Cuba as pawns working towards the Soviet Union’s ends in the Third World, the reality on the ground was far more complex. </p>

<p>In 
’s most recent two-part interview, Piero Gleijeses discusses this complexity in examining Cuba’s role in the Angolan War, based on extensive interviews and archival research he conducted for 
<a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469628325/visions-of-freedom/"></a>.  </p>

<p>The protracted war in Angola became the key battleground for influence in Southern Africa between the US and the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s until just before the Soviet government’s collapse in 1991. Cuba, too, deployed troops to Angola in 1975 — the country’s largest overseas military deployment in its history — at the invitation of the Angolan government, then controlled by the socialist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). This was not Cuba’s first time supporting revolutionary forces in a decolonizing African country: Cuba had provided support to the Front National de Liberation (FLN) in Algeria in the early 1960s, as well as sent troops to the Congo. </p>

<p>Drawing on sources from US, South African, and Cuban archives, Gleijeses argues that Cuban involvement in these African conflicts was motivated, above all, by a commitment to anti-imperialism, revolutionary internationalism, and, in the case of Angola, what Fidel Castro referred to as “
<a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v26/n16/piero-gleijeses/a-bone-in-the-throat">the most beautiful cause</a>”: anti-apartheid. </p>

<p>Listen to 
’s two-part interview with Piero Gleijeses<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/visions-of-freedom-w-piero-gleijeses-part-1/">here</a>and<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/">here</a>. You can also check out<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/visions-of-freedom-maps/">these maps</a>as a visual reference. </p>

<p>Having learned from their experience in the Congo, which they entered unprepared in their attempt to support revolutionary forces there, the Cubans understood the political situation in Angola far better than the Soviet Union and frequently disagreed with the Soviets on strategy and action. Gleijeses demonstrates how the Cubans did not make the same mistake again: Cuba played a crucial role in preventing US-backed apartheid South Africa from conquering Angola.</p>

<p>This 
 interview also invites a discussion on socialist internationalism today. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the idea of an international socialist project has waned. Despite periodic outcries against US imperialism, the resurgence of today’s US left has overwhelmingly focused on domestic politics. Gleijeses’s work asks some key questions for today’s leftists: What should a global socialist movement look like? And what types of material commitments and sacrifices might it take from those of us in the heart of empire?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Cuba’s history and present are often wildly misrepresented in US popular media. For an accessible overview of Cuban history,

<a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469628325/visions-of-freedom/"></a> focuses specifically on Cuba’s foreign policy in relation to Angola, his previous book, 
<a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9780807854648/conflicting-missions/"></a>, tells the story of the country’s revolutionary internationalism in the first fifteen years after the revolution. To learn more about imperialism and foreign policy, past and present, check out

<p>##Newsletter #7: The Immense Possibilities at the Heart of Our Past and Present, with David Wengrow</p>

<p>by William Harris</p>

<p>At a time when academia was becoming more and more hyper-specialized, the late David Graeber was a rare generalist. He was a committed activist and scholar who believed we could understand the kind of better society humans are capable of building by telling vast stories and asking daring questions about our lives together in the past, present, and future.</p>

<p>This is what led him to become an anthropologist. He wanted to study existing social forms in all their diversity, from<a href="https://iupress.org/9780253219152/lost-people/">his doctoral fieldwork in rural Madagascar</a>to his polemic against<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bullshit-Jobs/David-Graeber/9781501143335">the braindead hellscape of twenty-first-century</a>“bullshit jobs,” while also writing expansive histories that show us how the world wasn’t always the way it is now — and therefore might be different in the future.</p>

<p>After completing the monumental<a href="https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/debt/">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a>, Graeber spent much of the last decade of his life researching an even more ambitious project alongside his friend and intellectual inspiration, the archaeologist<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/david-wengrow-professor-comparative-archaeology">David Wengrow</a>. The fruit of that research is a new co-authored 700-page epic by Wengrow and Graeber,<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357">The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</a>— and also the subject of a mind-expanding new 
episode ofThe Digguest-hosted by<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/astra-taylor/">Astra Taylor</a>.</p>

<p>Listen toThe Dig’s interview with David Wengrow<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>At its most sweeping, the mainstream view of human history goes something like this: we once lived in small, egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands. With the rise of agriculture, these bands gave way to complex forms of hierarchy, class structure, and bureaucracy. This is a myth, Wengrow argues. Exploring an incredible range of sources, from French Enlightenment texts to Native American folklore and understudied archaeological sites in Mexico and Ukraine, Wengrow and Graeber uncover a history of revolutionary contingency, in which slave-holding hunter-gatherer societies develop next to egalitarian ones, diverse regional social networks are replaced by the narrower social worlds of cities and nation-states, settlements full of palaces and temples are felled in favor of the large-scale construction of spacious social housing, and the seeds of the Enlightenment lie not in Europe but in the rich cultures of debate and persuasion found among Indigenous societies in the Americas.</p>

<p>The real human story, Wengrow argues, is one of immense variation in social organization — and therefore one of immense possibility.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #6: US Workers Are Pissed Off and Striking Back</p>

<p>By Michal Schatz</p>

<p>Is the United States in the middle of a strike wave? The question saturated news and social media throughout October, as US workers from disparate industries across the country did something very few workers have done in recent years: walked off the job.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t get too far ahead of ourselves in examining these walkoffs: relative to its historical corollaries like the Great Depression–era strikes that established the labor movement as we know it, or even the recent teachers strikes that kicked off in 2018, today’s strike wave is miniscule. Decades of neoliberal policies have gutted organized labor’s power and weakened workers’ strike muscles. But as Alex Press, Victor Bouzi, and Jonah Furman emphasize in this week’sDigepisode, the industrial actions sweeping the United States indicate a shift in workers’ sense of their own power.The urgent task for both union members and the Left is to understand what has led to this renewed worker confidence — and how to harness it to rebuild the labor movement.</p>

<p>Listen toThe Dig’sinterview with Alex Press, Victor Bouzi, and Jonah Furman<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/striketober/">here</a>.</p>

<p>“Striketober” may be over, but the labor upsurge that kicked off last month isn’t: UAW members at John Deere shocked their management and union leaders when they<a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2021/11/well-never-be-position-again-striking-deere-workers-hold-out-better-deal">rejected a second tentative contract agreement</a>on November 2; Kellogg’s workers are in their<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/kelloggs-strike-bctgm-union-tiered-contracts">second month of striking</a>; and over 30,000 workers at Kaiser are<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/11/kaiser-alliance-health-care-unions-two-tier-strike">on the brink of a strike</a>. As Gabriel Winant and Jonah Furman<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/17/john-deere-strike-labor-market/">recently highlighted inThe Intercept</a>, workers in entertainment, manufacturing, the food industry, and beyond are no longer willing to work exorbitant hours for minimal pay while their companies’ profits skyrocket. For John Deere, Kaiser, and Kellogg’s workers, today’s labor demands are not simply about immediate material gains, but about correcting neoliberal policies like two-tier wage systems that have weakened unions for three decades and made compensation worse for workers across the United States.</p>

<p>We’re far from any credible declaration of unions’ revitalization. But if labor is going to rebuild power, it will take much more of the kind of militant action we’ve seen in recent weeks.</p>

<p>This interview is the latest addition toThe Dig’s extensive archive of<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/tag/labor-movement/">labor interviews</a>. As<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/labor-beat-reporting-newspapers-journalism-unions">Alex Press pointed out</a>inJacobin, labor reporting largely disappeared from local and national media during the 1990s and 2000. But it has slowly been rebuilt in recent years, and the current strike surge has benefited from detailed reporting.</p>

<p>Jonah Furman has provided excellent coverage of the ongoing John Deere strike on<a href="https://whogetsthebird.substack.com/">his SubstackWho Gets the Bird?</a>and forLabor Notes, most recently writing about how<a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2021/11/well-never-be-position-again-striking-deere-workers-hold-out-better-deal">workers forced Deere management back to the table</a>. ForJacobin, Alex Press has written extensively about the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees’ (IATSE) ongoing negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), showing that even before Halyna Hutchins was horrifically killed on the set of Rust<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/10/halyna-hutchins-shooting-rust-iatse-alec-baldwin">due to poor labor conditions</a>,<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/10/iatse-television-film-industry-union-strike-rank-and-file-overwork">many members were unsatisfied</a>with the terms of AMPTP’s contract proposal.

<p>##Newsletter #5: Desire Is Political, with Amia Srinivasan</p>

<p>by Maia Silber</p>

<p>Conversations about the politics of sex often focus on the presence or absence of consent. For feminist philosopher Amia Srinivasan, this is a profoundly inadequate framework — one that leaves us ill-prepared to interrogate the power dynamics that shape even the sex we freely choose, and suggests carceral remedies likely to harm society’s most vulnerable members.</p>

<p>Searching for alternatives, Srinivasan’s 
The Right to Sex: Feminism in the Twenty-First Centuryreaches back to the “sex wars” of the 1970s, when feminists fiercely debated how power informs our desires. In those debates, she often finds more questions than answers. Can we treat sex as political without subjecting ourselves and others to an authoritarian moralism? Can we reject the sexual shaming so often weaponized against women, queer, and gender non-conforming people without succumbing to the fantasy that our desires are wholly natural?</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging conversation on 
The Dig,Srinivasan brings these questions to bear on contemporary debates about sex on college campuses, pornography, and sex work. She argues, for instance, against critics who claim that teachers who enter consensual relationships with students don’t deserve our censure, while insisting that institutional responses do more to protect universities from liability than young people from abuse. She urges us to take seriously the power of pornography to shape not only sexual actions but also sexual affects and urges in harmful ways, even while recognizing the medium’s potential for inspiring radical modes of pleasure and sexual agency.</p>

<strong>The Dig</strong><strong>’s interview with Amia Srinivasan</strong>
<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/the-right-to-sex-with-amia-srinivasan/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>The titular essay in 
The Right to Sexcontroversially examines the claims of “incel” (involuntarily celibate) men to sexual entitlement. While Srinivasan insists that there is no right to sex, she takes seriously incels’ contention that sexual attraction is distributed unequally along hierarchies of race, class, and conventional attractiveness.</p>

<p>Incels hypocritically lament the ways these hierarchies harm them even while they subscribe to their valorization of certain kinds of bodies: the rich, thin, white women they call “Stacys.” Srinivasan thinks that we can take inspiration instead from queer and Black women who have asked us to critically interrogate who and how we desire. For Srinivasan, this isn’t about repression — it’s about openness to the forms of sex and love that are blocked by our current power structures.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #4: The Long, Disastrous History of US Intervention in Afghanistan, with Tariq Ali</p>

<p>By Ben Feldman</p>

<p>“What is most important to the history of the world[:] The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet Empire? A few crazed Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?” former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski asked rhetorically in a 1998 interview. He was justifying the United States’ partnership with religious reactionaries, which helped lead the Soviets to overextend themselves financially and militarily, and hastened the collapse of America’s rival hegemon. Absent from Brzezinski’s musing was any mention of the Afghan people themselves. Whether in 1979, 1998, 2001, or 2021, Afghans are ignored by US-policymakers and media, trudged out only when their suffering can be used as a cudgel against those who oppose war and occupation.</p>

<p>In a collection of essays written over four decades, 
<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3939-the-forty-year-war-in-afghanistan">The Forty-Year War in Afghanistan: A Chronicle Foretold</a> (Verso, November), Tariq Ali reconstructs the history of American intervention in  Afghanistan. Beginning with the Soviet invasion in 1979, the United States — with the help of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan — mobilized an international network of anti-Soviet Islamic fighters. In doing so, the U.S. and its Middle Eastern allies helped create a generation of militants whose “deracinated fanaticism” helped them to emerge from the second Afghan Civil War (1992-1996) as the dominant power in the country.</p>

<p>The Taliban’s rise was the unintended consequence of America’s Cold War foreign policy: decades of funding, training, and propping up right-wing forces throughout the world. Five years after the Taliban captured Kabul, they were swept out of power by the United States and its allies. What began as a war of revenge, a punishment for having harbored Osama Bin Laden — lasted twenty years, ending with the collapse of the Afghan National Security Forces and the Taliban’s retaking of Kabul on August 15, 2021. In the interim, a 
<a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll">quarter of a million people lost their lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan</a>, and 
<a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2020/Displacement_Vine%20et%20al_Costs%20of%20War%202020%2009%2008.pdf">some nine million Pakistanis and Afghans have been displaced</a> by the War on Terror.</p>

<p>Ali’s essays illustrate how the Afghan people have borne the costs of imperialistic hubris, Cold War rivalry, and America’s post-9/11 need for vengeance. Throughout, the reader is reminded of a basic point that eludes so many journalists and politicians: the crises facing Afghanistan today are the product of decades of policies which prioritized the political needs of U.S. elites over the safety, security, and independence of the Afghan people.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #3: Imagining Utopia in a Time of Climate Disaster with Kim Stanley Robinson</p>

<p>/wp:heading</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>By William Harris</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>By now you’ve seen the signs, planted across the liberal meadows of our nation’s lawns with a solemn pledge: “In this house, we believe: science is real.” Framed by this oath, science becomes an apolitical set of facts blindly assented to — which then easily translates into yet more grist for the neverending culture war between rational Democrats and troglodytic Republicans.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>How should today’s Left approach science? Few approach this question as thoughtfully as legendary science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson, hailed by the 
New Yorkeras perhaps 
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-greatest-political-novelist">“our greatest political novelist,”</a> author of many books — from the 
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/ZMS/mars-trilogy">Mars</a> trilogy to 2019’s 
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/kim-stanley-robinson/the-ministry-for-the-future/9780316300162/">Ministry for the Future</a>—and our guest on a provocative new episode of 
The Dighosted by pod-comrade and Berkeley sociologist Daniel Aldana Cohen.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>For Robinson, science is a utopian project that the Left should claim. A “modest” way of knowing the world, importantly available to specialists but also to all of us, science lives out an always-incomplete story full of dynamic adaptation, democratic debate, and messy engagement with the material world. If science has historically been a project shot through by warring interests — too often colonial and corporate — one of these competing interests has been the idealist, Left-aligned objective of improving the world for all.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Robinson comes to these reflections as a novelist who’s spent his career telling stories that entwine ecology and social justice. We live amid climate disaster; for science, that means that now is a time when, in considering technological fixes to climate change, “it all has to be put on the table.” Controversially, he insists, that means rethinking ecological and political approaches from geo-engineering to nuclear energy to Green New Deal-prompted quantitative easing.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Robinson’s broad-tent openness to a range of scientific possibilities to save our planet also comes from his experience as a novelist. His novels play out possible futures and dramatize a range of leftist and scientific debates, giving narrative shape to our most pressing ecological and political questions. Amid a growing body of criticism indicting contemporary literature for its failure to come to imaginative terms with ecological disaster — from Amitav Ghosh’s 2016 book 
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html">The Great Derangement</a> to Rithika Ramamurthy’s recent takedown of the 
<a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/climate-anxiety/">“Climate Anxiety Novel”</a> — Robinson’s work stands out as compellingly original approaches to possible climate futures. His latest epic 
Ministry for the Future imagines how a plausible “best-case scenario” under climate change future might come about, raising difficult questions of left ecological politics that he discusses with Cohen.</p>

<p>##Newsletter #2: Occupy Paved the Way for Today’s Reborn Left</p>

<p>/wp:heading</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>By Mia Schatz</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>It is hard today to remember the sense of desolation that plagued the American left a decade ago. Demoralized, disempowered, disorganized, the Left seemed to have no answer to the 2008 housing market crash and the Great Recession — until Occupy Wall Street.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Although the movement only lasted two months, Occupy left its mark on American politics, putting the potential for a meaningful left movement back on the map. In the years since, many participants have argued that Occupy failed: its horizontal structures didn’t work; it had no actionable demands; it was too white, too affluent, and unable to put a real dent in finance capital’s power. And yet, as Astra Taylor points out in this week’s episode of 
The Dig, Occupy reframed American political discourse around class, laying the groundwork for the highly effective messaging of Bernie Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, and compelled both veteran and budding organizers to rethink a problem the Left had struggled with for years: power.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>As Occupy faded, hundreds of former occupiers from across the country joined or formed organizations focused on housing, debt, healthcare, and climate change. Today, there is a growing American left energized not only by organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America and Black Lives Matter and stirrings in key parts of the labor movement, but also by left-aligned elected officials at national, state, and local levels who are challenging the power of capital.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Occupy offered critical lessons about how a political movement can build power without losing sight of its core principles. If, as Astra argues in this week’s interview, the Left of a decade ago was allergic to power and electoral politics, today’s Left has found the antidote in strong, well-organized institutions that are increasingly capable of holding its leaders accountable. These are essential questions that are still at the heart of left organizing today — and will only become more urgent as the post-Occupy left keeps growing.</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Occupy’s recent tenth anniversary inspired a wave of reflections and analyses. During Occupy, media attention focused heavily on the demographic composition of occupiers. As Dan and Astra discuss, labor scholars Ruth Milkman, Penny Lewis, and Stephanie Luce 
<a href="https://media.sps.cuny.edu/filestore/1/5/7/1_a05051d2117901d/1571_92f562221b8041e.pdf">interviewed occupiers on the ground at the New York occupation in Zuccotti Park</a>. Sarah Jaffe, host of 
Dissent’s 
Belabored podcast, recently 
<a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/belabored-the-legacy-of-occupy-wall-street">interviewed Ruth Milkman and Nastaran Mohit</a>, an organizer and one of the study’s interviewers, about their reflections on the movement a decade on. For 
Jacobin, Doug Singsen reminds us of 
<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/occupy-wall-street-ows-zuccotti-park-nyc-labor-movement-unions-collaboration">unions’ critical and often underplayed role</a> in various OWS occupations across the country, while Ross Barkan argues the 
<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/occupy-wall-street-new-york-city-dsa-bloomberg-cuomo">media was too quick to deem Occupy a failure</a>.And questions still linger about Occupy’s most influential political currents. Former occupier and current Pennsylvania State Senator Nikil Saval and 
Intercept columnist Natasha Lennard recently discussed 
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/occupy-socialist-anarchist/">whether Occupy was more socialist or anarchist in nature</a> in

<p><strong>The War on Terror Made Our World</strong></p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>by Micah Uetricht</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Twenty years since September 11, 2001, the War on Terror’s catastrophic effects can’t be overstated. Hundreds of thousands (at least) in the Middle East are dead; trillions have been funneled to the military-industrial complex; our already desiccated democratic institutions have been further weakened; a Pandora’s box of barbarous reactionary currents have been unleashed in the United States and abroad. Our world has been grotesquely deformed by the War on Terror.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Yet somehow, that war receives scant attention these days. Little of the voluminous mainstream discourse on the rise of Donald Trump mentions it. Even Bernie Sanders did not make opposition to the War on Terror central to his presidential campaigns. And when the war does grab headlines, as during Joe Biden’s recent pullout from Afghanistan, the obvious lesson — that the war cannot be won — escapes mainstream pundits. A grinding, decades-long, amorphously defined global military campaign with disastrous consequences and no real end in sight has been largely flushed down the memory hole.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Which makes Spencer Ackerman’s new book 
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622555/reign-of-terror-by-spencer-ackerman/">Reign of Terror: How the 9/11 Era Destabilized America and Produced Trump</a> (Viking) essential reading. Ackerman, a longtime national security reporter who writes the Substack “
<a href="https://substack.com/profile/2576701-spencer-ackerman">Forever Wars</a>” and won a Pulitzer at the 
Guardian for his reporting on the Edward Snowden revelations, traces the violence and toxicity unleashed by the twenty-year War on Terror: nativism, Islamophobia, erosion of civil liberties, militarization of police powers at home, indefinite detention abroad, torture, expansion of “anti-terrorist” military action far beyond the Middle East, the roles played by a bloodthirsty Republican Party convinced of its ability and right to reshape the world through violence and a Democratic Party that shamefully capitulates to the GOP’s framing of the war, the successful harvesting of the worst of these developments by Donald Trump, and much more. He discusses all of this in a three-part conversation with 
The Dig.</p>

<p>We’re known for extended conversations on politics, but this 
Dig series with Spencer Ackerman goes even deeper than usual. That’s because we can’t understand the United States today — its cruelties abroad, the rot it has accelerated at home, its normalization of the illegal and immoral in the name of national security — without understanding the War on Terror.</p>

<p>/wp:paragraph</p>

<p>wp:paragraph</p>

<p>Ackerman’s book is a crucial starting point, but the twenty-year anniversary of September 11, 2001 has brought numerous retrospectives on the War on Terror. Leftists, of course, have long denounced the war and did so again on the anniversary: Branko Marcetic writes for 
Jacobinabout how 9/11 
<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/september-11-anniversary-war-terror-bin-laden">could have provided an opportunity</a> to reflect on blowback to US imperialism but was squandered, and the 
Nation’s September 20/27 
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/issue/september-20-27-2021-issue/">issue</a> focuses on the spectacular failures of the War on Terror, including the explosion of 
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/muslim-american-race/">Islamophobia at home</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/gitmo-detainees-uae/">hellish experiences</a> of former Guantanamo detainees. Predictably, mainstream outlets were more ambivalent, but some liberal columnists like the 
New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/opinion/how-9-11-turned-america-into-a-half-crazed-fading-power.html">denounced</a> the war stridently.</p>
