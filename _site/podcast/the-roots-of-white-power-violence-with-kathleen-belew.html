  <p>The man who carried out the massacre in Pittsburgh was apparently motivated by a belief that Jewish people were conspiring to destroy the white race by way of orchestrating mass immigration.

. Dan interviews Kathleen Belew on her book 
, a history of the white power revolutionary movement from 1975-1995.</p>
