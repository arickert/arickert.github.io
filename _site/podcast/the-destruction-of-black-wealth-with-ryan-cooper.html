  <p>Journalist @ryanlcooper talks about the new paper he wrote with @MattBruenig, founder of the @PplPolicyProj, a new left-wing think tank founded by Bruenig and funded by the people. Foreclosed: Destruction of Black Wealth During the Obama Presidency details how the Wall Street-induced foreclosure epidemic wiped out huge swaths of black wealth—and how Obama, the first black president, could have taken multiple actions to save most homes but did not. Check out the report http://peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf and this article about it jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality.
