<meta name="twitter:description" content="Perhaps nothing has more defined the monstrosity of Donald Trump than his racist demonization and targeting of immigrants from Mexico, Muslim-majority countries and those nations he deems to be “shitholes” or, according to another account, “shithouses.” But what’s seldom reported is that one of the key mechanisms that the Administration has used to target immigrants was rolled out under Barack Obama. It’s called Secure Communities, and it’s the culmination of decades of policymaking and politicking that have intertwined the United States systems of mass incarceration and immigrant enforcement—facilitating the growth of both. To fight both mass deportation and mass incarceration, localities and states must move beyond what’s currently defined as sanctuary, as a new report by Kade Crockford from the Century Foundation and ACLU of Massachusetts Also: Check out Dan’s essay on Trump’s proposal to execute drug dealers And thanks to Verso Books.
