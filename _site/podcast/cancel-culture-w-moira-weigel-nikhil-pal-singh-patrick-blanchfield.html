  <p>What is so-called cancel culture? Why has it suddenly emerged as arguably 
the issue in right-wing politics? How does today’s cancel culture discourse differ from the anti-PC discourse that first emerged in the early 1990s? How do we distinguish between liberal opponents of PC like Jonathan Chain and right-wing ones like Donald Trump? And then, finally, is there still a 
there there? Some problems with The Discourse that we should reflect upon?</p>
