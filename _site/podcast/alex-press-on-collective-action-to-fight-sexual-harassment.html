  <p>The exposure of Weinstein’s predations has reignited widespread fury  over the longstanding problem of sexual harassment and  assault—especially in the workplace. Jacobin editor @alexnpress  discusses two new pieces she wrote on how dealing with these problems as  individuals only ends up harming individual women and why women must  organize to fight back.
