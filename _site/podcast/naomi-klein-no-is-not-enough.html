  <p>Donald Trump appears to many in the guise of a terrifying aberration. But in reality, he is the outcome of trends that are far too normal. We need movements to come together to not only defeat Trump but to take on the system that made him possible. Naomi Klein takes on Trump’s brand, and offers some thoughts as to how to tarnish it, in her new book “No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump’s Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need.” Thanks to our sponsors at versobooks.com and at FSG, promoting the excellent new book “Locking Up Our Own” by James Forman Jr.</p>
