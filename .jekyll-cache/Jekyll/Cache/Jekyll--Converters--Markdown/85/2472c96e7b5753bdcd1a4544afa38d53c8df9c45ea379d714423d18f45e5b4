I"Õ<p>Part two of a two-part interview with AslÄ± BÃ¢li on the Syrian civil war and the larger geopolitical conflicts that shape the Middle Eastâ€”with an emphasis on the role played the United States. During part one, which you should definitely listen to first, BÃ¢li discussed the various powers sacrificing the lives of Syrian people in the pursuit of their perceived geopolitical and sectarian interests. In this installment, BÃ¢li discusses the restrictive frames that dominates the American discussion over Syria, and then assesses the lack of a coherent heterodox left-wing foreign policy in the United Statesâ€”something that we desperately need as the possibility of the left taking power becomes newly plausible.</p>
