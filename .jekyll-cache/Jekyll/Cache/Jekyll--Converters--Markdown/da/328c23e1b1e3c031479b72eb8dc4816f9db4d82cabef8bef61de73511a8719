I"ﬁ<p>Fifty years ago, a mainstream group of high-profile Americans declared the following: ‚ÄúOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white‚Äîseparate and unequal. Reaction to last summer‚Äôs disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division. Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life; they now threaten the future of every American. This deepening racial division is not inevitable. The movement apart can be reversed. Choice is still possible. Our principal task is to define that choice and to press for a national resolution.‚Äù The Kerner Commission, established by President Johnson, embodied left liberalism at its most bold and idealistic. But that vision of radical reform was eviscerated by the American war on Vietnam, the rise of neoliberalism and the modern conservative movement, and liberal triangulation that reached its apotheosis under Bill Clinton.</p>
