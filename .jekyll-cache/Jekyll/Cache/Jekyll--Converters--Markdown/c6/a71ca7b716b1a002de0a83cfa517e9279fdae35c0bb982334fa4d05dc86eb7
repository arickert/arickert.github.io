I"ÿ<p>In Ecuador, the left won reelection this year, after Alianza PA√çS candidate Lenin Moreno, former President Rafael Correa‚Äôs vice president, narrowly won election this year. It was a major victory given the crisis hitting the pink tide of left governments throughout the region. But it was perilously close to a loss. Correa accomplished a lot for the country‚Äôs poor majority but did so thanks to a commodity boom that has since gone bust, a strategy that put the left government in conflict with indigenous and environmental movements. Dan‚Äôs guest today is Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College. Thanks to our supporters at nacla.org, the best source for left-wing analysis on Latin America.</p>
