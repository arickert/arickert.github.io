I"§<p>James Comey is liberal Americaâ€™s favorite cop and now, as a result, a bestselling author as well. Patrick Blanchfield returns to talk about his Baffler review of Comeyâ€™s new book. Itâ€™s awful, of course. But itâ€™s bad in productively revealing ways. Comey has become an icon of the liberal fetishization of the national security state as a bulwark against Trumpismâ€”when it fact it is that very national security state and its rampant abuses that are deeply implicated in Trumpâ€™s rise. The elevation of police as a model of duty and leadership contrasted against Trumpâ€™s vulgar monstrosities renders invisible not only why Trump won but why he is so dangerous.</p>
