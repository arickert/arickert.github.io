I"q<p>Last week, we posted an interview Dan recorded in Barcelona on Spanish politics—specifically the question of Catalan independence, and also the municipalist movement governing cities like Barcelona. What we didn’t really talk much about was the fact that the conservative Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy was about to fall—which it did, just a few days later. So, Dan brought sociologist Carlos Delclós back for a follow-up interview.</p>

<p>Production note: Dan sounds like he’s speaking in an aquarium or calling into his own show because he fucked up the recording. So don’t blame Alex Lewis.</p>
