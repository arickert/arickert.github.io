I"∆<p>Jacobin Managing Editor Micah Uetricht pulls Dave-Davies-duty for Dan and interviews Rossana Rodr√≠guez-Sanchez, a DSA member running for alderwoman in Chicago. Rodr√≠guez-Sanchez moved to Chicago from Puerto Rico, where the brutal austerity imposed on the island made her job as a teacher impossible. She has brought with her a radical tradition and a program to fight for the city‚Äôs beleaguered public schools, for renters and for immigrant rights, and for a public safety agenda that prioritizes social workers over cops.</p>
