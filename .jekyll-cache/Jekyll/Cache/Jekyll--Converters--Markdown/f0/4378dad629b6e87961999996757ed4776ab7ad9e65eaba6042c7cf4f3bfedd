I"¨<p>Robert Reich, Bill Clintonâ€™s Labor Secretary, explains one of Clintonismâ€™s most dreadful results: President Trump. The new film available on Netflix, is Reichâ€™s quasi-autobiographical documentary about the origins of contemporary political-economic inequality. The premise that capitalism ought to be saved notwithstanding, Reich offers firsthand insight into Clintonâ€™s rightward rush into the arms of Corporate America.
