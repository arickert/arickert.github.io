<p>Historian Howard Zinn died in 2010. Today, he remains a model for left-wing intellectuals in how to both convey ideas to a public beyond academia and how to take direct action to transform the world.</p>

<p>Teaching at Spelman, a black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Zinn supported and advised the student sit-in movement. During the war on Vietnam, he traveled to Hanoi to receive American prisoners whom the North Vietnamese had shot out of the sky. And he published 
A People‚Äôs History of the United States, a book that prompted many readers to, for the very first time, see the United States‚Äôs foundational myths of American innocence and meritocratic reward as lies.</p>

<p>As Eric Foner wrote in an obituary for the Nation, ‚ÄúFew historians managed to reach a broad non-academic audience. Those who do generally write monumental history, works that celebrate great men or heroic events. Zinn‚Äôs history was different. . . . Zinn‚Äôs public learned about ordinary American struggles for justice, equality and power.‚Äù Foner continued,</p>
