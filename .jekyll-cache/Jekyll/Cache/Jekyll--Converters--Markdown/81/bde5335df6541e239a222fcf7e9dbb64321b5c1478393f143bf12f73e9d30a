I"î<p>American liberty has since its foundation relied upon the dispossession of indigenous people and Mexicans, upon African enslavement and, ultimately, upon the constant fleeing outward that created an empire that none dare call by its name. As historian Greg Grandin writes in he End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America, this expansionist project has finally lost its ideological and material vitality, no longer able to neatly reconcile centuries of mounting contradictions. And so politics returned to the border as American expansion hit a wall‚Äîfiguratively and, as Trump has demanded, very literally. ‚ÄúTrumpism,‚Äù Grandin writes, ‚Äúis extremism turned inward, all-consuming and self-devouring. There is no ‚Äòdivine, messianic‚Äô crusade that can harness and redirect passions outward. Expansion, in any form, can no longer satisfy interests, reconcile contradictions, dilute the factions, or redirect the anger.‚Äù</p>
