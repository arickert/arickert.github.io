<p>Historian Howard Zinn remains a model for left-wing intellectuals who want to not only convey ideas to a public beyond academia but also take action to transform the world that it is their profession to explain. Dan interviews Keeanga Yahmatta-Taylor, a leading intellectual of today’s resurgent socialist left, on her foreword to a new edition of Zinn’s autobiography, You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train.</p>
