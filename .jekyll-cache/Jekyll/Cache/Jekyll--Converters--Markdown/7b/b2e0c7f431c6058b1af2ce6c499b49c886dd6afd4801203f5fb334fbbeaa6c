I"‡<p>Letâ€™s ensure that the history of American socialism doesnâ€™t repeat as farce. Thatâ€™s one reason that Max Elbaum wrote 
Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao and Che, an account of the little-remembered New Communist Movement that defined the American anti-capitalist Left of the 1970s. Their internationalism, anti-racism and cadre organization were in many ways admirable. Their dogmatism and sectarianism proved disastrous. Elbaum relates this history, and the lessons that the New Left failed to learn from the Old Leftâ€”lessons that todayâ€™s resurgent left would be wise to study.</p>
