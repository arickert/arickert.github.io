I"À<p>Stephen Wertheim, a Lecturer in American and international history at Birkbeck, University of London, breaks cuts through the suffocating foreign policy debate that shapes American Empire under Trump.</p>

<p>Peace has broken out across the Korean Peninsulaâ€”or, at least, the odds that Donald Trump will blow the world up have gone down a just a bitâ€”at least temporarily. Yes, Trump is the one who pushed us way too close to the brink of nuclear war. And yes, he likely sought peace with Kim Jong-Un because he loves wins, whatever their political or ideological content. But wow, has the liberal reaction been revealing. According to the mindset that pervades the liberal media and political elite, a move toward peace with North Korea is bad because Trump is bad. Or perhaps worse yet, itâ€™s bad because the national security state conventional wisdom that has governed Washington under both parties for so longâ€”purveyed by the very people who have brought us endless war almost everywhereâ€”says that itâ€™s bad. Itâ€™s clearer than ever that the task of the left to find a way out of this ideological closed circuit of the liberal vs. Trump foreign policy debateâ€”and, if we win power, to shut down its warmongering for good.</p>
