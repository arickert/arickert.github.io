I"ù<p>Fighting for Black Lives Under Trump</p>

<p>The Movement for Black Lives‚Äô insistence that black lives matter is deceptively straightforward and minimal. But it has transformed black politics, and American politics as a whole.</p>

<p>From the tension and contradiction of the Obama years, in which a black man became the most powerful person on earth but conditions continued to worsen for black people as a whole, the Movement for Black Lives erupted and made radical demands for social and economic justice, and to an end to police violence and mass incarceration. The movement now has to find a way forward in the time of Trump‚Äôs law-and-order backlash.</p>
