I"ò<p>The protest movement against the onset of the Iraq War was countered by a call to ‚Äúsupport our troops‚Äù from militarists on the right. Venerating American soldiers, of course, is not about supporting actual American soldiers but is rather a rhetorical device to preclude questioning or criticism of the wars they are sent to fight. In a face-to-face interview at Brown University‚Äôs Watson Institute, anthropologist Catherine Lutz discusses John Kelly‚Äôs recent diatribe, Khizr Khan, Trump‚Äôs attack on protesting NFL players and the roots of it all in the Nixon Administration‚Äôs response to GI rebellion against the Vietnam War.
