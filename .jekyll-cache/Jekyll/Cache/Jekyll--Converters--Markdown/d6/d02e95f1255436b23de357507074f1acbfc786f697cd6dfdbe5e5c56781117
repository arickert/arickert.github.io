I"Ä<p>Last week, we posted an interview Dan recorded in Barcelona on Spanish politicsâ€”specifically the question of Catalan independence, and also the municipalist movement governing cities like Barcelona. What we didnâ€™t really talk much about was the fact that the conservative Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy was about to fallâ€”which it did, just a few days later. So, Dan brought sociologist Carlos DelclÃ³s back for a follow-up interview.</p>
