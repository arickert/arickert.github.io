I"™<p>Black Lives Matter is a poignant slogan and a powerful force for social transformation. Itâ€™s also shorthand for a huge array of organizations, mostly led by people that youâ€™ve never heard of, working the daily hard grind of ordinary organizing that stitches together spectacular mass actions into a movement. Thatâ€™s the subject of the new book 
by Danâ€™s guest, historian and activist Barbara Ransby.</p>
