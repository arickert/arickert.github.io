I"<p>Prisons don’t just keep inmates in; they keep the public out. Even at a moment when mass incarceration is under unprecedented criticism it is quite hard for people on the outside to empathize with people who they cannot see or speak to. My guests today are Brett Story and Jordan Camp. Story is a filmmaker who has made an incredible new documentary called <em>The Prison in 12 Landscapes</em>, which shines a harsh light on America’s prison archipelago without ever taking a peek inside. Camp is a scholar of the carceral state.</p>
