<p>Two left-wing Muslim women newly elected to Congressâ€”Palestinian-American Rashida Tlaib and Somali-American Ilhan Omarâ€”are resetting the Congressional debate over Palestine. In response, they have been met with slanderous attacks. On the one hand, this is exciting: weâ€™ve never had people in Congress not only criticizing Israeli brutality but also supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. On the other hand, the current debate is a sobering reminder of how amongst American elected officials, overwhelming, and nearly unconditional, bipartisan support for Israel remains the norm even as Democratic voters move leftwardâ€”and in increasing opposition to the occupation. Dan speaks to organizer Linda Sarsour on the politics of Palestine in fluxâ€”and how partisan polarization on the issue is accelerating, and why thatâ€™s a good thing.</p>
