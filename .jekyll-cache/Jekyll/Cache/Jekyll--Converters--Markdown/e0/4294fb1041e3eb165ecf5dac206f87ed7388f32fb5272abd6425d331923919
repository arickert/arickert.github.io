I"ò<p>The latest installment in our ongoing series on the left and electoral politics and weâ€™re talking about Democratic Socialists of Americaâ€™s new electoral strategy. DSA has almost overnight become a serious force on an American socialist left that has for decades lacked much in the way of serious forces. One of the major reasons the organizationâ€™s membership rolls blew up, of course, was because of Bernie Sandersâ€™ historic 2016 run for president, which not only electrified huge swaths of the country but reminded the radical left that the point is to win power and to governâ€”and that, after years on the margins, we could do so. This was in part because many Americans were no longer afraid of the s-word: socialism. Yet there is still, for many good reasons, a lot of skepticism about electoral politics in general and the Democratic Party very much in particular, inside DSA and across the socialist left. Thatâ€™s the needle that the new DSA electoral strategy document tries to thread.</p>
