I"¤<p>Featuring Laura Weinrib on The Taming of Free Speech: Americaâ€™s Civil Liberties Compromise. Did you know that the ACLU was founded as a radical labor organization allied with the IWW? Weinrib traces the rise of the modern civil liberties movement, and modern constitutional liberalism more broadly, from World War I through the New Deal. She explains how the ACLU went from defending free speech as a means to revolutionary ends to a liberal position exalting free speech as an end unto itselfâ€”including the anti-union speech of bosses and the political speech of corporations.</p>
