<p>The US colony of Puerto Rico has been repeatedly shocked and Puerto Ricans are traumatized. That is precisely what successful shock doctrines like this oneâ€”which wants to remake the island into a utopia for rich Americans and crypto-bros and a dystopia for everyone elseâ€”depend upon.</p>

<p>This is is the subject of Naomi Kleinâ€™s new book from Haymarket, The Battle For Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes on the Disaster Capitalists. Today, Klein returns to The Dig, and is joined by Mercedes MartÃ­nez, president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation.</p>
