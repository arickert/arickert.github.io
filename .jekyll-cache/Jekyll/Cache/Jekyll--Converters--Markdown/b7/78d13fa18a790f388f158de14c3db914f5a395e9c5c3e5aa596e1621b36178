It received just two ‚Äúno‚Äù votes in the Senate: from Rand Paul and Ron Wyden. It‚Äôs a problem of hegemony: prohibition has long been plain common sense. So, it‚Äôs our job to change that. The first step is to make it clear that there is dissent, and that prohibition is self-evidently neither good policy nor good politics.</p>
