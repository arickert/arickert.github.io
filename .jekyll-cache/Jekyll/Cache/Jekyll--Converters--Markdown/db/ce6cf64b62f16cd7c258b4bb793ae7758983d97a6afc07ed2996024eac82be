I"	<p>Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor returns to The Dig to discuss her new book <em>How We Get Free: Black Feminism and the Combahee River Collective</em>. Forty years ago, a group of black feminists coined the term “identity politics” in the Combahee River Collective Statement. For them, it was a way to identify the various ways that capitalism, racism, patriarchy, and homophobia created a set of interlocking oppressions. And the point of identifying how those systems operated together was not to create an itemized politics of particularity, as is too often the case today, but rather to create a framework for solidarity.
