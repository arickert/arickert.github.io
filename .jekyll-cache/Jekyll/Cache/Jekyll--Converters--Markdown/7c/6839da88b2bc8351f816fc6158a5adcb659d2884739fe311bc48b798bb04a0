<p>David Harvey has taught Capital to huge numbers of people everywhere. Dan interviews him about his latest book, <em>Marx, Capital and the Madness of Economic Reason</em>. Harvey explains why he thinks all three volumes are of Capital are key, why we’re still living under neoliberalism at least unless and until ethnonationalist autarchy pushes it aside, how capitalism might survive climate change via mass immiseration, and linking struggles over production and consumption in the fight to transform society toward socialism. And more.</p>
