I"<p>Over the past two years, the belief that left-wing activism is responsible for a surge of right-wing reaction has become a sort of catechism for talking heads and mainstream Democrats who insist that calls to ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù are the single greatest threat to the Democratic Party‚Äôs political prospects. For want of immediate evidence, centrists intone sagely about the election of 1972, when George McGovern and his radical supporters pushed white, middle-class suburbanites into the arms of Richard Nixon.</p>

<p>Kim Phillips-Fein‚Äôs 2009 bookInvisible 
Hands: 
The 
Businessmen‚Äôs 
Crusade 
Against 
the 
New 
Dealargues against this ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù narrative. Phillips-Fein locates the roots of the Right‚Äôs rise not in the cultural politics of the New Left, but in the 1930s, when a small group of wealthy businessmen refused to accommodate themselves to the New Deal order. Though their fierce opposition to the welfare state put them at the political margins during the 1930s, these reactionaries helped tame American liberalism in the 1940s and 1950s while laying the groundwork for the Reagan Revolution.</p>

<p>Through the institutions they built and the networks of conservative businessmen they cultivated, opponents of the New Deal waged a decades-long war to transform the ways that Americans thought about the market, organized labor, and the role of federal government. Above all else, they worked to convince people ‚Äî in particular cultural conservatives ‚Äî that free enterprise and entrepreneurship represented the highest expressions of human freedom, and thus that any effort at asserting democratic control over the generation and distribution of wealth, must be understood as an assault on the most cherished values of a free people.</p>

<p>At first glance, we canalmostreadInvisible 
Handsas a road map for the contemporary Left: an example of how a small band of committed activists can, over the course of decades of steadfast political commitment, transform mainstream assumptions about economics and politics. But we should be wary of drawing too many direct lessons from this story. After all, few leftists have the cash, and few one-percenters have the inclination, to fund this sort of ideological campaign.</p>

<p>Still, there are lessons to be gleaned from Phillips-Fein‚Äôs interpretation of the conservative movement. As we search for a useable past, we should look for links and threads across eras. Just as the roots of the neoliberalism of the 1980s and 1990s might be found in the early New Deal, the roots of some future Left may be found in social formations and forms of protest which seem marginal today.</p>

<p>As Phillips-Fein and Dan discuss in this week‚Äôs interview, the limits of the libertarian worldview have been put into particularly sharp relief in recent years. It is ‚Äî or at least it should be ‚Äî impossible to view exposure to an airborne pandemic as a matter of individual responsibility. And yet, from the<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/bidens-pandemic-w-justin-feldman/">Biden 
administration‚Äôs 
push 
for 
a 
return 
to 
normal</a>while a pandemic still rages, to the<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/cryptocurrency-w-edward-ongweso-jr-jacob-silverman/">feverish 
utopianism</a>around<a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/private-money-with-stefan-eich/">cryptocurrency</a>, evidence of the persistence of this vision are all around us.</p>

<p>We live in the world these businessmen helped build. But while leftists may not be in a position to precisely trace the path of the businessmen‚Äôs crusade,Invisible 
Handsshould remind us that the political certainties of today may be anything but certain tomorrow.</p>
