<p>The prospect of nuclear war with North Korea sits near the top of the list of things that have been unthinkably bad about Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency. But the conflict with North Korea didnâ€™t begin with Trump. Itâ€™s critical that we understand the Koreas and their historical context right now. Journalist @TimothyS breaks it all downâ€”North Korea, South Korea, the role of the US and othersâ€”from World War II to the present. And he argues that peace is possible, but it can only achieved through engagement between North and South, not through bellicose US intervention. Thanks to Verso Books for their support.
