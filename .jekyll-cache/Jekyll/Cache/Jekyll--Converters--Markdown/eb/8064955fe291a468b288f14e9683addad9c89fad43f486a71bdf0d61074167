I"Î<p>Sorry to Bother You is a hilarious film about the dead serious shitiness of life under neoliberalismâ€™s flexibilized and precarious labor regime, a system teetering upon a thin line between free labor exploitation and a form of expropriation reminiscent of full-on slave laborâ€”all at the mercy of the thinly-veiled barbarity of Palo Alto-style techno-utopianism. Itâ€™s about how capitalist society divides and conquers friends and family to claim not only our obedience but also our very souls, and about how the task of left organizing is to see through that game and fight together. Danâ€™s guest today is Boots Riley, who wrote and directed the film and also fronts the left-wing hip hop group The Coup.</p>
