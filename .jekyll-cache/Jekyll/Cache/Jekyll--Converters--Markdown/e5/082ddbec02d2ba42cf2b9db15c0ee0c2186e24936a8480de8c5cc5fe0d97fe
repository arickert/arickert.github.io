I"√<p>What if the Cold War only just ended in November 2016, as Donald Trump grotesquely encircled and then captured the presidency, finding it, to his surprise, unguarded? The Cold War proper, of course, ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Aziz Rana, making his second Dig appearance, argues that it was a lot more than the conflict with the Evil Empire. It was a domestic order that, he writes in the latest issue of n+1, ‚Äúconcerned everything from the genius of America‚Äôs domestic institutions to the indispensability of its global role. These judgments gave coherence to the country‚Äôs national identity‚Äîallowing both Barack Obama and Bill Kristol to wax poetic about America‚Äôs special destiny as a global hegemon‚Äîand legitimacy to its economic policy. But with the 2016 election, the cold-war paradigm finally shattered.‚Äù Check out Aziz‚Äôs article <a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-30/politics/goodbye-cold-war/">here</a>.
