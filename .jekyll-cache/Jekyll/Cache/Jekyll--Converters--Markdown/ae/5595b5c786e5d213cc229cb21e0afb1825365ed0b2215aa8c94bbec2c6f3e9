<p>What is gentrification? It isnâ€™t just about what was once known as the hipster and is still known as the artist, the telltale warning signs of impending demographic change. Itâ€™s part of an entire political-economic order that has made real estate global capitalismâ€™s most prized asset for storing wealthâ€”one that has helped bend place-based urban governments to the will of mobile, and thus more powerful, capital. Dan interviews Samuel Stein on his book, Capital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State.</p>
