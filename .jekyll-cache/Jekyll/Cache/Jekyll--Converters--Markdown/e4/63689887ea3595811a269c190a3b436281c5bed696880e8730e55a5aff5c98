I"¶<p>An interview with three members of Reclaim Philadelphia, which emerged from the Bernie 2016 campaign in Philly and has sinceâ€”in a remarkably short amount of timeâ€”played a key role in getting Larry Krasner elected District Attorney, effectively won a state legislative seat, and taken over two Democratic Wards in the city. Much of the debate on the left over how to engage in electoral politics revolves around how to relate to the inside and outside of electoral politics as they currently exist: in other words, how to approach the unfortunate reality of the Democratic Party. Reclaim Philadelphia brings an outsider perspective and base to a hard-nosed insider game.Â Nikil Saval, Rick Krajewski and Amanda Mcillmurray explain what they do and how they do it.</p>
