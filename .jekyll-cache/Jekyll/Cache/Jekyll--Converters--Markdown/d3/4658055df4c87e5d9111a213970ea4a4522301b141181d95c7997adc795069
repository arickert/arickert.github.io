I"é<p>Todayâ€™s Dig is a very good and somewhat unusual Dig: Danâ€™s got two interviews with two different people. First, journalist Eric Blanc on the teacher strike wave that heâ€™s been covering for Jacobin. Then comes the Center for Popular Democracyâ€™s Xiomara Caro Diaz on last weekâ€™s May Day demonstrations against austerity in Puerto Rico.</p>
