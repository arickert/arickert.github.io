I"Ö<p>How does gun culture get built from the ground up? What are the everyday politics of guns? Sociologist Jennifer Carlson does ethnographic fieldwork that provides answers to these questions, showing how men see guns as a way to be a protector in a time of economic precocity and how the NRA‚Äôs massive training operation helps shape the racialized identity of ‚Äúcitizen protectors‚Äù defending ‚Äúsheeple‚Äù against the ‚Äúwolves.‚Äù Thanks to our supporters at Verso Books.
