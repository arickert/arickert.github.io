I"¥<p>Your first Diglet of the new year, and weâ€™re talking about that Trump book. At n+1 Patrick Blanchfield makes the case that <em>Fire and Fury</em> is not, as some might think, a bunch of meaningless palace-intrigue that has distracted us from what Trump is doing to destroy the environment and wage relentless class war against the poor. Rather, the book in one fell swoop exposes the Trump administration for the dangerously hot mess that we all knew it was but were entirely unable to understand clearly because the deluge of drama and weird tweets had rendered it all banal wallpaper.
