Legendary socialist scholar Tariq Ali on the long history of Afghanistan: the 19th and early 20th-century wars against the British Empire; the communist coup, Soviet invasion, and US-backed mujahideen war; the rise of the Taliban; and the 2001 US-led NATO invasion through the recent US defeat and withdrawal. Plus, a lot about Pakistan.

Pre-order Ali's forthcoming book [The Forty-Year War in Afghanistan: A Chronicle Foretold](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3939-the-forty-year-war-in-afghanistan)
