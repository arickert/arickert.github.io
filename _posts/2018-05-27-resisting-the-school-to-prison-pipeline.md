The steady pace of school massacres has revived calls to put more cops in school. And so atrocities committed by white students are exploited to make schools more like prisons, and ensure that the former remain a rapid-fire pipeline into the latter.

Danâ€™s guests are Dakota Hall, the Executive Director of Leaders Igniting Transformation, a youth of color led organization fighting the school to prison pipeline in Milwaukee; and Dmitri Holtzman, the Director of Education Justice Campaigns at the Center for Popular Democracy.
