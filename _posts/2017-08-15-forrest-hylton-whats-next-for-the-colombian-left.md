The FARC peace accord is a historic victory for Colombian society. But the struggle to build an urban left strong enough to take on the country's powerful right remains a daunting one.

Check out a great article from Forrest [here](https://www.academia.edu/26907051/The_Experience_of_Defeat_The_Colombian_Left_and_the_Cold_War_that_Never_Ended) And also Forgotten Peace: Reform, Violence, and the Making of Contemporary Colombia from our supporters at University of California Press [here](https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520293939)
