Dan interviews sociologist Paolo Gerbaudo on his book 
The Digital Party: Political Organisation and Online Democracy. How does the promise of direct digital democracy obscure how leaders are made more powerful and less accountable? Examples from Italy (Five Star Movement) and Spain (Podemos). How does the failure to incorporate people into rooted forms of political organization undermine the left's power, coherence, and durability? Example from the USA (the funhouse mirror-appeal of a certain YouTube comedian).
