Featuring Amna Akbar, Gabriel Winant, and Thea Riofrancos on the emerging terrain of struggle. Is American liberalism exhausted or revitalized? What are the successes and limits of the new US left electoral strategy? Is there a new anti-electoral mood amongst socialists? Why donâ€™t we have a powerful climate movement? What forces are making and remaking the American working class today? The second and final part of a very wide-ranging interview.
