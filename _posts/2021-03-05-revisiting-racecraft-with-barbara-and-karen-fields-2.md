We're taking a week off to play catch up and posting an early Dig episode from the archives that people keep returning to time and again: Barbara and Karen Fields on their book 
Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life (episode 75 from December 13, 2017). Peruse The Dig's vast archives at 
[thedigradio.com](https://thedigradio.com)and we'll be back with a new ep next week.
