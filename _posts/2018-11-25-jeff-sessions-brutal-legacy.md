Guns in general, and American gun culture in particular, have created a horrific bloodbath. But much of the liberal gun control movement has, in concert with the NRA and Republican Right, worked to make the war on guns a central facet of mass incarceration. The upshot is that we have the worst of both worlds: a society flooded with guns, where the paradigmatic white "good guy with a gun" treasures his weapons as a bedrock constitutional right even as the supposed "bad guys with a gun," often black men with a felony record, are mercilessly prosecuted for carrying. Dan talks to reporter George Joseph, who has a 
[new piece up at](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/jeff-sessions-gun-prosecutions.html) on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' war on guns, which has led to a sharp increase in federal gun prosecutionsâ€”often hitting ordinary black men with felony records who are simply carrying for their own protection.
