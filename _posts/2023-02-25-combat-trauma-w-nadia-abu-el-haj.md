Featuring Nadia Abu El-Haj on *Combat Trauma: Imaginaries of War and Citizenship in Post-9/11 America*. A truly remarkable book about the unseen ideological foundations of American militarism: American civilians are enjoined to venerate troops, deferring to their traumatized positionality. The first in a two-part interview.
