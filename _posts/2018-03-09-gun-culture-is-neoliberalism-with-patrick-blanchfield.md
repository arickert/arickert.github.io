Neoliberal culture is one that expects little from government and everything from plucky individualsâ€”including, apparently, the self-sacrificing courage to charge an AR-15 wielding gunman while your classmates cower behind bulletproof backpacks. Writer Patrick Blanchfield returns to the show to discuss his recent essays on guns for New York magazine (forthcoming) and [The Intercept](theintercept.com/2018/02/28/parkland-florida-school-shootings-arming-teachers).
