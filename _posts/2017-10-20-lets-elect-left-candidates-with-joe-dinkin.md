Since Bernie Sanders's success in the 2016 Democratic primary, much  of the Left, from progressive Democrats to socialists, has had its  sights set on something we had long at least implicitly assumed was  impossible: state power and governing. The question now is how to take  power, and the Left is consumed by debates over how and whether to  engage with the Democratic Party or, in a more limited fashion, with the  Democratic Party's ballot line. Joe Dinkin of the Working Families  Party talks to Dan about the promise and pitfalls of fighting within the  Democratic Party. Thanks to our sponsors at Verso Books.
