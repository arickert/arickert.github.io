If Kerri Evelyn Harris wins in Delaware, she will have knocked out an incumbent US Senator. And that would be a really big deal. Harris, a left candidate backed by Justice Democrats, is Dan's guest today. She is the latest candidate putting forward the bold proposition that in a democracy ordinary people should govern themselvesâ€”particularly since well-credentialed incumbents like her opponent, Senator Tom Carper, so often do the bidding of corporate interests.
