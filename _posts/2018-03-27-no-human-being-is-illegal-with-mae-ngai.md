Many Americans take the existence of so-called "illegal immigrants" for granted, whatever their opinion of the matter. But illegality isn't a property of immigrants; rather, it's a creation of positive law. And we can only understand how immigrants are declared "illegal" by the government by examining this country's too-often ignored history of racist and exclusionary immigration politics. Danâ€™s guest today is Mae Ngai, an historian at Columbia and the author of *Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America*. Thanks to Verso Books.
