Featuring Naomi Klein on how the pandemic turbocharged a far\-right conspiracist politics that’s sweeping into power. This strange new world, however, is a product of an old contradiction: the need to disavow and deny a long history and awful present; the inability to make sense of the extreme violence and oppression that makes everyday Western capitalist society possible. 

We discuss Klein’s book *Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World* and her *Guardian* essay “How Israel has made trauma a weapon of war”: [theguardian.com/us\-news/ng\-interactive/2024/oct/05/israel\-gaza\-october\-7\-memorials](http://theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/05/israel-gaza-october-7-memorials)
