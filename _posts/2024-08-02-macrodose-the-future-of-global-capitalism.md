Dan just did a live *Dig* in London with Jeremy Corbyn and Laleh Khalili. It was part of a podcast doubleheader that included this recording of the economics podcast *Macrodose* featuring Asad Rehman, James Meadway, and Thea Riofrancos. The live *Dig* with Corbyn and Khalili on internationalist and anti-imperialist politics will be posted in a few days.
