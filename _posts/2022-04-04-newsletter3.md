By William Harris

By now you've seen the signs, planted across the liberal meadows of our nation’s lawns with a solemn pledge: “In this house, we believe: science is real.” Framed by this oath, science becomes an apolitical set of facts blindly assented to — which then easily translates into yet more grist for the neverending culture war between rational Democrats and troglodytic Republicans.


How should today’s Left approach science? Few approach this question as thoughtfully as legendary science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson, hailed by the 
New Yorkeras perhaps 
[“our greatest political novelist,”](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-greatest-political-novelist) author of many books — from the 
[Mars](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/ZMS/mars-trilogy) trilogy to 2019’s 
[Ministry for the Future](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/kim-stanley-robinson/the-ministry-for-the-future/9780316300162/)—and our guest on a provocative new episode of 
The Dighosted by pod-comrade and Berkeley sociologist Daniel Aldana Cohen.


For Robinson, science is a utopian project that the Left should claim. A “modest” way of knowing the world, importantly available to specialists but also to all of us, science lives out an always-incomplete story full of dynamic adaptation, democratic debate, and messy engagement with the material world. If science has historically been a project shot through by warring interests — too often colonial and corporate — one of these competing interests has been the idealist, Left-aligned objective of improving the world for all.


Robinson comes to these reflections as a novelist who’s spent his career telling stories that entwine ecology and social justice. We live amid climate disaster; for science, that means that now is a time when, in considering technological fixes to climate change, “it all has to be put on the table.” Controversially, he insists, that means rethinking ecological and political approaches from geo-engineering to nuclear energy to Green New Deal-prompted quantitative easing.


Robinson’s broad-tent openness to a range of scientific possibilities to save our planet also comes from his experience as a novelist. His novels play out possible futures and dramatize a range of leftist and scientific debates, giving narrative shape to our most pressing ecological and political questions. Amid a growing body of criticism indicting contemporary literature for its failure to come to imaginative terms with ecological disaster — from Amitav Ghosh’s 2016 book 
[The Great Derangement](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html) to Rithika Ramamurthy’s recent takedown of the 
[“Climate Anxiety Novel”](https://www.thedriftmag.com/climate-anxiety/) — Robinson’s work stands out as compellingly original approaches to possible climate futures. His latest epic 
Ministry for the Future imagines how a plausible “best-case scenario” under climate change future might come about, raising difficult questions of left ecological politics that he discusses with Cohen.
