Introducing Thawra, a miniseries on 20th century Arab politics. Over the coming 16 episodes, host Daniel Denvir and historian Abdel Razzaq Takriti delve into the history of the diverse political radicalisms and revolts that have swept across Arab lands in the past century. Denvir and Takriti demystify the fundamental coloniality of the modern Middle East—including of Israel, the Zionist settler colony launched by the British.


This project is brought to you from the Dig, Daniel Denvir’s Jacobin podcast on politics, history, and economics everywhere.
