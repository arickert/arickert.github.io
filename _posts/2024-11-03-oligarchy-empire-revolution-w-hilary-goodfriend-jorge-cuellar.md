Featuring Hilary Goodfriend and Jorge Cuéllar on the history of Central America. This is the first episode in a two\-part series covering the late\-19th and early\-20th century rise of export\-crop oligarchies and constant US intervention, the US\-backed separation of Panama from Colombia to take control of the Canal, the CIA’s 1954 Guatemala coup, the rise of armed revolutionary movements in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and the US\-backed dirty wars that were prosecuted in response—that and so much more.
