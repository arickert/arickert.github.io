From The Dig & Jacobin Magazine: a new narrative series about how COVID-19 has changed everything and nothing at all. Right now, human contact is perceived to be a threat. The density that makes cities wonderful--it has people scared. But also, we can only survive together. Frontline workers organizing. D&D games played over zoom. Humanity isn't the enemy; it's the antibody.
