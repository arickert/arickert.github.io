Three thinkers and organizers on the much debated question of ultra-leftism post-Bernie 2020. Two texts that informed our discussion: 

[The Liberal to Ultra-Left Pipeline: Breaking the Cycle](https://washingtonsocialist.mdcdsa.org/ws-articles/21-03-breaking-the-cycle) by Brian W. 

[Liberalism, ultraleftism or mass action](https://www.marxists.org/archive/camejo/1970/ultraleftismormassaction.htm), a speech delivered by Socialist Workers Party leader Peter Camejo.
