Journalist @ryanlcooper talks about the new paper he wrote with @MattBruenig, founder of the @PplPolicyProj, a new left-wing think tank founded by Bruenig and funded by the people. Foreclosed: Destruction of Black Wealth During the Obama Presidency details how the Wall Street-induced foreclosure epidemic wiped out huge swaths of black wealthâ€”and how Obama, the first black president, could have taken multiple actions to save most homes but did not. Check out the [report](https://peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf) and this [article about it](jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality).
