Serious people in Washington are seduced by vapid and self-serving accounts of their savvy operation of the machinery of government—works like Bob Woodward's latest exercise in extended stenography Fear: Trump in the White House. The problem with Trump—for defenders of the establishment political order that helped make his presidency possible—is precisely that he's not a man like John McCain, a bloodthirsty and world-historically successful self-mythologizer. Patrick Blanchfield on his [review of Fear in n+1 ](https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/dupe-throat/) and
[obituary of John McCain in](https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-mccain-phenomenon-blanchfield).
