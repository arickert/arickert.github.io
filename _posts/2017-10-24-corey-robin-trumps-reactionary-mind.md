@CoreyRobin points to a tension that has defined conservatism from the  get-go, between two competing conceptions of virtue and nobility: one  defined by political and military distinction and another by  entrepreneurialÂ  acumen and accumulated wealth. Robin parses how Trump  fits into this dynamic history, in part by taking a look back to seminal  conservative thinkers like Edmund Burke and Friedrich Hayek. Thanks to  our sponsors at Verso.
