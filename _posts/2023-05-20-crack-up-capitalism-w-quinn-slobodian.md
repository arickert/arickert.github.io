Featuring Quinn Slobodian on *Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy*. Radical libertarians, including anarcho-capitalists like Murray Rothbard, envision a world of micro-polities governed by private property and contract. In fact, we already live in their world, a world of zones—places where special rules tailor-made for capitalists prevail over the ordinary laws of the nation-state.
