In July 1936, a majority of the 3,000-member Associated Employees of South Works voted to affiliate with the CIO\'92s Steel Workers\'92 Organizing Committee. The South Works group was a company union, established by US Steel to suppress real labor organizing. But seven years into the Great Depression, the South Works employees had had enough of the company\'92s empty promises of worker empowerment. The company union had become \'93a Frankenstein\'92s monster to the employers who created them,\'94 according to one journalist at the time.\
I thought of that incident \'97 recounted in historian Lizabeth Cohen\'92s classic book {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/making-a-new-deal/E27B0C6C73EF62AABBDA46D6015AB2CC"}}{\fldrslt 
\f2\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919-1939}} \'97 while listening to this week\'92s episode of 
\f2\i The Dig. 
\f1\i0 In it, labor organizers Rob Baril, Jaz Brisack, and Chris Smalls, and labor reporters Luis Feliz Leon and Alex Press, discuss what\'92s motivating the recent surge of labor militancy. One clear theme that emerges from their wide-ranging discussion is labor\'92s increasing unwillingness to accept management\'92s fictitious claims of equality in the workplace.\

Starbucks, notes Brisack, calls its staff \'93partners,\'94 even while compelling them to work in unsafe conditions during a pandemic. Workers at her now-unionized Buffalo store and at least twenty other locations that have voted to hold National Labor Relations Board elections nationwide are now demanding the power their title implies.\
I\'92m not the only one to make the parallel to the 1930s. As Leon and Press point out, many of today\'92s organizers themselves hope to fulfill the unrealized calls of activists in that era for \'93industrial democracy\'94 \'97 a substantive form of worker control in the workplace. There are obvious parallels between today\'92s crisis and those of the Great Depression that might again help engender the rise of a mass labor movement.\
Still, I\'92d temper that optimism somewhat: workers organizing today also face novel challenges after a half-century of neoliberal policies that have not only weakened organized labor but also decimated working-class communities.\
Today, we don\'92t face a revival of the laissez-faire-ism of the early-twentieth century so much as a new regime characterized by mass incarceration, punitive welfare programs, and imperial state-building. Confronting that new regime will require new vision and new strategy, even if we draw on inspiration from the past. What gives me hope is that organizers such as Baril, Brisack, and Smalls are embracing such innovation, seeking to build a labor movement that will not only match the achievements of New Deal-era industrial unionism but go far beyond them.\
As Cohen\'92s title suggests, no moment of crisis inevitably gives rise to union power. Workers had to 
\f2\i make 
\f1\i0 a New Deal, as we will have to forge whatever era of labor history we hope will come next.\
